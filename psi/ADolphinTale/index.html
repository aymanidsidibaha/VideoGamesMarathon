<p>Inside of the Peacock Room in San Francisco’s Mark Hopkins hotel,&nbsp;Silicon Graphics chairman Jim Clark <a title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/sgi_pr.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/sgi_pr.html">announced an agreement</a>
 to create the technology for Nintendo’s next gen console, the Ultra 64.
 An animated 3-D image of Mario is projected onto a movie screen behind 
Clark. “Jeeeemy, I may be a big star, but I don’t let it go to my head,”
 said the CGI animated Mario. Jim Clark turned his head to the animated 
Mario and responded,”Mario, I’d like to be the first to welcome you to 
your new home at Silicon Graphics. &nbsp;I think you’re really going to 
have a nice, happy time here.” &nbsp;At one point, Silicon Graphics was 
considered to become the next Apple, and received praise for their state
 of the art technology used on films such as “Jurassic Park” and 
“Terminator 2”.</p>
<p>Edward McCracken, the president and CEO of Silicon Graphics,&nbsp;<a title="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rec.games.video.nintendo/hB5O3_JMH7E/LqQTZi1DAfEJ" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rec.games.video.nintendo/hB5O3_JMH7E/LqQTZi1DAfEJ">released a statement</a>:&nbsp;“By
 pooling the best and brightest talent from both our 
companies,&nbsp;[Nintendo Ultra 64] will propel Silicon Graphics’ 
leading digital media&nbsp;technologies into homes everywhere. 
Nintendo’s financial and technical investment&nbsp;combined with Silicon
 Graphics’ engineering resources will enable our two&nbsp;companies to 
continue leading the visual computing and home 
entertainment&nbsp;industries in the ’90s.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those happy times at Silicon Graphics were about to 
come to an end.&nbsp;One year after Nintendo signed the Project Reality 
deal with Silicon Graphics, drama was gradually escalating behind the 
scenes causing analysts to question whether Jim Clark was slowly losing 
power over the company. &nbsp;Multiple reports detail a power struggle 
over the company with constant fighting back and forth between Jim Clark
 (Chairman) and Ed McCracken (Chief Executive).</p>
<p>“Fucking Ed McCracken,” shouted Jim Clark. “That fucking Ed 
McCracken”. According to the book, “The New, New Thing” written by 
author Michael Lewis, Clark would call him “Fucking Ed McCracken” so 
many times that employees at Silicon Graphics started thinking that was 
his real name. Lewis explains in his book, “Clark would say McCracken 
may have helped to stabilize the company, <strong>but now he’s destroying it</strong>. He can’t see what’s happening.”</p>
<p>Jim Clark knew personal computers would one day perform everything 
that a Silicon Graphics workstation could do. Clark could see trouble 
brewing from a mile away with Microsoft quickly dominating the market 
for personal computers. &nbsp;“You&nbsp;could see a time when the PC 
would be able to do the sort of&nbsp;graphics that SGI machines did,” 
said Clark. “And SGI would&nbsp;be toast. Eventually, Microsoft would 
take over its business.”</p>
<p>He believed that the only way SGI’s business could survive is if they
 created more mass market products with their technology.&nbsp; These 
beliefs are what lead Silicon Graphics to create a chipset for the 
Nintendo 64. Basing their business around mass market products was a 
vision that McCracken and venture capitalists like Glenn Mueller didn’t 
share. &nbsp;With Ed McCracken and Glenn Mueller running the show, Clark
 was quickly losing power over the company. &nbsp;Clark had sold 40 
percent stake in Silicon Graphics to Glenn Mueller and kept 15 percent 
stake for himself.&nbsp; As time passed by, Clark regretted the 
decision, and he started to believe Mueller had cheated him and his 
engineers out of a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>“I was saying, ‘Goddamn we’re&nbsp;out of our minds,” said Jim Clark&nbsp;<a title="http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15199804" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15199804">during an interview</a>.
 “I was so worried about the PC. &nbsp;I was adamant that we had to 
build a low-end product, and&nbsp;that it had to be something that sold 
for under five grand.”</p>
<p>The book “The New, New Thing” talks about how Clark used business 
meetings to insult Ed McCracken’s character and lack of foresight. 
McCracken would break out into tears as Clark described everything that 
was wrong with him. Author Michael Lewis says, “One time, Clark replaced
 the nameplate on&nbsp;McCracken’s door with one that said ED MCMUFFIN 
(the joke grew out of the inability of&nbsp;Clark’s teenage daughter to 
recall McCracken’s name). For four days, no one noticed. 
Clark&nbsp;would later haunt McCracken at board meetings with references
 to this incident, heaping insult&nbsp;upon humiliation.”</p>
<p>In 1994, Jim Clark resigned from Silicon Graphics, one year after 
Nintendo signed a deal with Silicon Graphics. His resignation raised 
many eyebrows at Nintendo of America, and it would be the first of many 
blows to the relationship between Nintendo and Silicon Graphics. Glenn 
Mueller, the man that Clark felt cheated him and his engineers, caught 
wind that Clark was starting up a new company called “Netscape”. Mueller
 had made some bad investments, and he begged Clark to let him be part 
of this new company. Clark rejected him multiple times, and on the day 
that Netscape was officially founded, Mueller shot himself in the head.</p>
<p>That same year, Silicon Graphics <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKlbx5niBu8" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKlbx5niBu8">releases a video</a> to show off the capabilities of their Nintendo Ultra 64 technology. &nbsp;<strong>Thomas A. Jermoluk</strong>,
 the president of Silicon Graphics, is the man that you first see in 
this video. You may also remember Jermoluk as the person who <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yketwu2GsE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yketwu2GsE">revealed Nintendo 64 at the E3&nbsp;press conference</a>
 with Howard Lincoln and Peter Main. Unfortunately, Silicon Graphics, 
the company behind the cutting edge technology of the Nintendo 64, 
transformed into a frat house by the year 1997.&nbsp;According to a <a title="http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm">BusinessWeek article</a>,
 insiders describe a July ’96 European Sales conference where managers 
and executives were getting drunk and carousing into the after hours. 
&nbsp;President/COO Thomas A. Jermoluk (and several colleagues) were <a title="http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm">seen mooning</a>
 other SGI employees at one the company’s annual lip-synch contests. 
Another incident in Hawaii talks about Jermoluk drinking and throwing up
 at a poolside sales meeting.</p>
<p>Jermoluk said, ”Am I guilty of getting drunk a few times?’ ”Sure. 
&nbsp;Probably inappropriately at times? Yeah. Did I party hard? Was I 
leading a wild life? No. I was working too hard, man.”&nbsp;A former 
executive told BusinessWeek that employees weren’t used to seeing the 
president get drunk.</p>
<p>On August 1st, 1996, Thomas Jermoluk <a title="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/01/business/president-of-silicon-graphics-decides-to-resign.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/01/business/president-of-silicon-graphics-decides-to-resign.html">resigned as president</a>
 from Silicon Graphics, two months before the Nintendo 64 would launch 
in North America. &nbsp;With Clark and Jermoluk both gone, most of the 
people that Nintendo of America had trusted at Silicon Graphics were no 
longer there. Edward McCracken would assume Jermoluk’s duties when the 
company was still going through major transitions.</p>
<p>As Silicon Graphics accumulated losses, the company’s employees and 
board members remained optimistic that CEO Edward R. McCracken would 
eventually turn things around. &nbsp;But after McCracken’s marriage fell
 apart, he established a public relationship with a younger SGI 
employee. Sources&nbsp;<a title="http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm">told BusinessWeek</a>&nbsp;that McCracken was constantly walking with stars in his eyes while SGI employees were in a funk.&nbsp;<a title="http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/1997/31/b35381.htm">BusinessWeek sai<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span></a>&nbsp;there
 were times when nobody bothered to coordinate introduction schedules at
 SGI’s product divisions. Other incidents include SGI computers shutting
 down without warning or engineers discovering flaws in the 
microprocessors that would cost the company millions of 
dollars.&nbsp;Employees lost confidence in McCracken’s ability to lead 
the company, and many of their most talented engineers left to pursue 
better opportunities.</p>
<p>On October 1997, Ed McCracken resigned from Silicon Graphics, and 
between 700 to 1000 employees (9 percent out of a 11,000 
total&nbsp;workforce) were laid off.</p>
<p>The news of Ed McCracken stepping down caused Nintendo&nbsp;<a title="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4044411/The-startup-that-saved-ATI" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4044411/The-startup-that-saved-ATI">to&nbsp;rethink their relationship</a>&nbsp;with
 Silicon Graphics and begin searching for a new partner. &nbsp;Silicon 
Graphics was struggling to retain a contract with Nintendo for their 
next gen console.”Nintendo has been looking to replace MIPS as its chief
 source of microprocessors for game units since last year, when former 
SGI CEO Ed McCracken stepped down. Nintendo was nervous about SGI’s 
commitment to low-end 64-bit processors,”&nbsp;<a title="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-211633.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-211633.html">according to CNET</a>.</p>
<p>Next Gen Magazine described Silicon Graphics having arguments with 
Nintendo over component profits after the Nintendo 64’s American’s 
launch MSRP was lowered at the last minute before launch. Although both 
companies eventually worked out a deal, the arguments rubbed Nintendo 
the wrong way, and SGI would no longer be considered a guaranteed 
partner for Nintendo’s post N64 game console.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Nintendo’s quest to find a new chip-maker wouldn’t be 
easy. The industry’s top 3D chip experts were being lured away by NEC 
and Nvidia, and&nbsp;Nintendo was running out of options for potential 
partners with their new console design team. One group that showed 
serious interest in developing Nintendo’s post-N64 console was The 3DO 
Company Hardware Group.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.linkedin.com/in/reneeiffert">LinkedIn account</a>&nbsp;of a software engineer named&nbsp;<strong>Rene Eiffert</strong>,
 3DO’s negotiations with Nintendo lasted from 1995 through 1997 (the 
year after Nintendo 64 launched in North America). &nbsp;The 3DO Company
 Hardware Group later changed their name to Cagent, and negotiations 
with Nintendo started back up again in 1997 through April 1998. 
&nbsp;Both Linkedin listings below describe a sales effort to persuade 
Nintendo into serious negotiations to use an engine in their next game 
console.</p>
<p>3DO’s hardware division had operated under the name 3DO Systems which
 developed and sold their M2 technology to Panasonic for over $100 
million. &nbsp;Eventually, 3DO decided to exit the hardware business and
 sell off their hardware division to Samsung where it was renamed to 
CagEnt. &nbsp;Cagent owned multiple technologies like a realtime MPEG 
encoding system, a DVD playback system, and a completed game console 
with brand new chip designs. &nbsp;Next Gen Magazine said, “The MX 
chipset was a dramatically enhanced version of the M2 chipset sold 
to&nbsp;Panasonic and Matsushita, now capable of a 100 million pixel per
 second&nbsp;fillrate and utilizing two PowerPC 602 chips at its core. 
(CagEnt’s executives&nbsp;also boasted of a four million triangle per 
second peak draw rate, though the&nbsp;quality of those tiny triangles 
would of course have been limited).”</p>

<p>Next Gen Magazine reported that Nintendo executives Howard Lincoln 
and Genyo Takeda had visited CagEnt’s facilities. By late 1997, Nintendo
 made a formal offer to acquire CagEnt from Samsung. According to Next 
Gen Magazine:</p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">As purchase 
negotiations continued, Nintendo worked with CagEnt engineers 
on&nbsp;preliminary plans to redesign the MX architecture around a MIPS 
CPU, as&nbsp;Nintendo’s manufacturing partner NEC has a MIPS development
 license but none to&nbsp;produce the PowerPC 602. Nintendo and CagEnt 
flip-flopped on whether the&nbsp;finished machine would include a 
built-in CD-ROM or DVD-ROM as its primary&nbsp;storage medium, with 
Nintendo apparently continuing to insist that ROM&nbsp;cartridges would 
remain at the core of its new game system. Yet as DVD and 
MPEG&nbsp;technologies would have been part of the CagEnt acquisition, 
Nintendo would&nbsp;probably have found some reasonable use for those 
patents eventually.&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">The&nbsp;MX-based machine was to be ready for sale in Japan in fall 1999</strong><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"> — in other&nbsp;words, </span><strong style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">development
 of games for the new console would begin within literally&nbsp;months, 
starting with the shipment of dev kits to key teams at Rare 
and&nbsp;Nintendo’s Japanese headquarters.”</strong></p>
<p>The clock was winding down. Nintendo wanted to release their next gen
 console&nbsp;as soon as Fall 1999 and as late as holiday 2000, but they
 would get hit by a string of bad luck.&nbsp;Samsung and Nintendo 
couldn’t reach a final agreement on the ownership of CagEnt, and Samsung
 would eventually sell CagEnt to Microsoft where it would become the Web
 TV division. After the CagEnt deal fell through, Nintendo shifted their
 focus to a small company named ArtX, made up of former Silicon Graphics
 engineers who designed Nintendo 64’s hardware. Nintendo’s visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1145794">sparked debate inside of ArtX</a> about how a relationship with Nintendo could impact them in the long run.</p>
<p>“We said we really didn’t want to divert ourselves, but Nintendo can 
make a pretty compelling argument and it was a pretty huge opportunity, 
so we decided to go ahead in mid-98,” said Tim Van Hook, chief designer 
for the Nintendo 64 and founder of ArtX.</p>
<p>For a new company like ArtX, the opportunity to work with Nintendo 
seemed too good to pass up. ArtX eventually forged a deal to develop the
 Flipper Chip for Nintendo’s next gen console, and in return, ArtX 
received royalties from Nintendo.</p>
<p>But not everyone was thrilled over this new agreement. &nbsp;SGI 
filed a trade secret violation against ArtX for using SGI’s secret 
information to directly compete against SGI and steal away their 
partners. SGI and MIPS threatened&nbsp;<a title="http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/1872175/artx-choice-revives-lawsuits" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/1872175/artx-choice-revives-lawsuits">multiple lawsuits including</a>:
 Engaging in unfair competition,&nbsp;misappropriated trade secrets, 
interfering with prospective economic advantage, and&nbsp;breaching 
contract. Some of the ArtX employees named in suit included ArtX Chief 
executive Wei Yen and ArtX founder Tim Van Hook.</p>
<p>“I not only want to get the company performing to where it needs to, 
but we will also be protecting our intellectual property and we intend 
to reinforce this,” said Richard Belluzzo, the new CEO of Silicon 
Graphics.</p>
<p>ArtX’s Greg Buchner <a title="http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1145794" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1145794">told EETimes</a>,&nbsp;“They
 [Nintendo] had given up on SGI. The last of the people they trusted 
were gone, and they went looking for the people. It’s not a 
company-to-company thing for [Nintendo]; it’s a person-to-person thing.”</p>
<p>By May 28, 1998, Silicon Graphics would eventually drop its lawsuit with ArtX. Nintendo, who previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.cnet.com/news/artx-ousting-mips-from-nintendo/">contributed $45 million annually</a> to the profits of MIPS Group, would officially break off their relationship. Ex-SCI employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/03/01/ati_confirms_400m_artx_takeover/">told The Register</a> that the lawsuit was dropped because SGI didn’t want to intimidate Nintendo.</p>
<p>On May 4, 1999, the internet swirled with rumors<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/05/say-hello-to-project-dolphin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/05/say-hello-to-project-dolphin">&nbsp;from an IGN</a>&nbsp;article
 describing&nbsp;Nintendo’s next gen console code-named Dolphin. 
&nbsp;The source told IGN that four companies (Rare, Retro Studios, EAD,
 and NST) already had development kits and were currently in the process
 of creating software for the Dolphin.”Management is claiming better 
graphics than the PSX2 (PlayStation 2),” a Nintendo insider told IGN64. 
“And supposedly it will run on DVD, but that’s still a&nbsp;<em>big</em>&nbsp;maybe
 at this point.” The article continues,&nbsp;“The buzz is that the 
system is a lot easier to program for than the Nintendo 64. &nbsp;And it
 appears Art-X [the system’s graphics chip provider] managed to slap out
 a nasty chipset for pretty cheap.”</p>
<p>During Nintendo’s press conference at E3 1999, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/14/nintendo-press-conference-transcript" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/14/nintendo-press-conference-transcript">took the stage</a>
 to officially announce their next gen console. &nbsp;Lincoln told the 
press that Nintendo’s next gen console would be code-named “Dolphin,” 
and it would be “extremely powerful and not expensive”. He announced 
that the graphics chip would be developed by Art X, and they would be 
lead by Dr. Wei Yen who was responsible for the N64’s graphics chip.</p>
<p>Lincoln told the audience,&nbsp;“We are absolutely confident that 
Dolphin’s graphics will equal or exceed anything our friends at Sony can
 come up with for Playstation 2.”</p>
<p>The Dolphin would feature a 400 MHz CPU called the Gekko processor 
which would be created by IBM. &nbsp;In addition, Lincoln announced that
 Dolphin would not feature ROM cartridges which resulted in applause 
from the press. &nbsp;He remained quiet on what type of medium that 
Dolphin would use instead.</p>
<p>Lincoln wrapped up his speech, “We’ve lifted the curtain a little on 
Dolphin. But we aren’t going to lift it all the way. &nbsp;We’re going 
to continue to be very circumspect in revealing all of Dolphin’s specs… 
for a very simple reason — there are more technological surprises to 
come, and we’d like to keep them just that — surprises — for you and 
especially for our competitors.&nbsp;But as I stand here this afternoon,
 I think Nintendo is very well positioned to take on Sony and Sega.”</p>

<p>On October 19, 1999,&nbsp;Nintendo&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/19/piecing-dolphin-together" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/19/piecing-dolphin-together">ordered more than 300 billion yen</a>&nbsp;($2.8
 billion) worth in conductors for it’s next-generation machine, 
codenamed “Dolphin”. &nbsp;The first round of semiconductors would be 
ready by August 2000. <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/19/piecing-dolphin-together" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/19/piecing-dolphin-together">According to IGN</a>,&nbsp;NEC
 announced that they would spend an estimated 80 billion yen ($761 
million) to construct a factory in southern Japan. &nbsp;This factory 
would concentrate on the production of memory and graphics 
semiconductors for the Dolphin. &nbsp;Nintendo’s Hiroshi Imanishi&nbsp;<a title="http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-delays-dolphin-console/106173" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-delays-dolphin-console/106173">spoke on the challenges</a>&nbsp;of keeping Dolphin’s costs down when the<a title="http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-delays-dolphin-console/106173" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-delays-dolphin-console/106173">&nbsp;</a>price of semiconductors keep increasing.</p>
<p>“We will need to make it cheaper than PlayStation 2,”&nbsp;said Imanishi.</p>
<p>Although Hiroshi Imanishi&nbsp;was never a household name, he was 
second in command during his tenure at Nintendo, and he spoke on behalf 
of former Nintendo president, Hiroshi Yamauchi.</p>
<p>Yamauchi&nbsp;<a title="http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/crontab/t-5575.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/crontab/t-5575.html" target="_blank">echoed Imanishi’s comments</a>&nbsp;about pricing. &nbsp;He believed that pricing should be as low as possible so more consumers can play the software.</p>
<p>“A game machine that sells for close to 40000 yen [$380] can be 
bought by young people old enough to work part-time jobs, but at any 
rate, is too expensive to be aimed at children. &nbsp;The Dolphin will 
not be that expensive.”<em>&nbsp;</em>said Yamauchi. In a seperate 
interview, he further elaborated,&nbsp;“People do not play with the game
 machine itself. &nbsp;They play with the software, and they are forced 
to purchase a game machine in order to use the software. Therefore the 
price of the machine should be as cheap as possible.”</p>
<p>In 2000, many consumers patiently waited for the launch of Sony’s 
highly anticipated PlayStation 2. That didn’t stop Nintendo executives 
from hyping up a possible Dolphin launch around the same time-frame. 
They would also take an opportunity to downplay PlayStation 2’s 
graphical performance.</p>
<p>“We plan to stick to this date,”&nbsp;promised Nintendo’s Managing 
Director Sales &amp; Marketing, Axel Herr. &nbsp; He then&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/33-more-powerful-than-ps2" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/33-more-powerful-than-ps2">spoke on Dolphin’s specs:</a>&nbsp;“In
 terms of graphics, we came up with extremely fast chip architecture 
that, according to our technicians, will be 33% above the projected 
performance data of [Sony’s] PlayStation 2.&nbsp; That’s easily twice as
 fast as [Sega’s] Dreamcast.”</p>
<p>Some analysts believed Sony’s PlayStation would have never gained a 
significant lead in market share if the Nintendo 64’s launch hadn’t 
experienced constant delays. &nbsp;Nintendo promised that they wouldn’t 
make this mistake again with their next gen 
hardware.&nbsp;Yamauchi&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/17/yamauchi-reiterates-low-price-and-holiday-release" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/17/yamauchi-reiterates-low-price-and-holiday-release">reconfirmed Nintendo’s plans&nbsp;</a>to
 launch Dolphin shortly after PlayStation 2&nbsp;in late 2000.&nbsp;“We 
would like to release the Dolphin closer to the PS2, but since we’re 
aiming for the Christmas 2000 shopping season, I don’t think the time 
difference is that big of a handicap,” said Yamauchi.</p>
<p>A Nintendo 64 developer&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3">told IGN</a>
 that if “Perfect Dark” and “Donkey Kong 64” sell well, Nintendo 
wouldn’t release their next generation hardware until 2001. &nbsp;If 
Nintendo feels threatened by the competition, then the next Nintendo 
console would release October 2000. &nbsp;Another source <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3">told IGN </a>that
 Nintendo was planning to ship the console by October 2000, but some 
people in the company weren’t entirely convinced it was possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ‘Dolphin’ missed the targeted Christmas 2000 shopping 
season. &nbsp;The delay would give Sony the advantage of releasing their
 console one year before its competitors. &nbsp;For investors, the delay
 of Dolphin’s launch felt like Nintendo 64 all over again, where Sony 
accumulated market share before N64 had a chance to launch. 
&nbsp;According to Nintendo’s Hiroshi Imanishi, <a title="http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-delays-dolphin-console/106173" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-delays-dolphin-console/106173">the reason</a> for Dolphin’s delay was obvious — the software wasn’t ready.</p>
<p>“It’s always the case with Nintendo, the hardware is already completed, but the software is not,” said Imanishi.</p>
<p>Nintendo <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/10/nintendo-makes-dolphin-delay-official" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/10/nintendo-makes-dolphin-delay-official">downplayed the disappointment</a>&nbsp;of the delay, and said the delay was good because it allowed fans to spend more money on games for the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>“A 2001 launch for Project Dolphin is not only in keeping with the 
normal product lifespan for our home consoles, but provides two 
important benefits,” said Peter Main, Nintendo’s executive vice 
president of sales and marketing. “First, it allows the millions of 
current Nintendo 64 owners to devote their video game dollars to the 
best lineup of new games in our history-without having to buy a new 
system. Secondly, the new launch date for Dolphin means that our system 
will come to market next year with a portfolio of game names across all 
genres that simply can’t be matched by any other company.”</p>
<p>Howard Lincoln was later quizzed by GameSpot about whether Dolphin 
would be harmed by the delay. GameSpot reminded Lincoln that Nintendo 64
 was the last to launch against Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.</p>
<p>Lincoln replied, “I think the key in this is that if you look at the 
N64 experience, I don’t think we were hurt at all by being late or after
 Sony. Very likely we were hurt by the number of games – but the number 
of games had more to do with problems with development tools, and we 
won’t make the same mistake again on the Dolphin.” He later 
adds,&nbsp;“We’re not so concerned about being late, as much as we’re 
concerned about focusing on taking care of any disadvantages we may have
 had. Or in other words, maximizing our competitive advantages – 
franchises, characters, and things of that sort. In terms of technology,
 I’m absolutely convinced the Dolphin will be as good as the 
PlayStation2. I’m sure they’re both going to look just super.”</p>

<p>Throughout the lifespan of the Nintendo 64, the company faced 
criticism for not having third party developers in mind when creating 
the Nintendo 64’s hardware and development tools. Nintendo of America 
Chairman Howard Lincoln would <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/16/lincoln-says-sorry-to-third-parties" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/16/lincoln-says-sorry-to-third-parties">publicly&nbsp;apology for</a>&nbsp;the
 lack of third party support.&nbsp;“With the complexity of N64 
technology it is incumbent upon us, and good business sense, to fully 
support third parties through the development process. To date, I don’t 
think we have provided as much support as we did with the Super NES and 
NES platforms,” said Lincoln.</p>
<p>Years later, Lincoln&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-reflects-on-history-for-dolphin-2448541" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-reflects-on-history-for-dolphin-2448541">would reflect back&nbsp;</a>on
 the Nintendo 64 days, and promised that we wouldn’t see a repeat of 
that situation. “I would say that we are deliberately making the Dolphin
 easy to program for – very strong development tools – because we 
learned our lesson with the Nintendo 64,” said Lincoln.</p>
<p>Miyamoto&nbsp;<a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/4897" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/4897">spoke on the challenges</a>&nbsp;of
 Nintendo 64 development and the transition from 2D to 3D game 
development. &nbsp;He believed that the struggles some third parties 
faced during the N64 era were necessary because it forced weaker 
developers out of the industry and made the remaining developers much 
stronger.</p>
<p>“It was hard to develop for the Nintendo 64, especially because the 
software libraries were delayed. However, the Nintendo 64 truly brought 
developers into the era of 3D, and there were bound to be problems with 
that,” said Miyamoto. &nbsp;“I suppose developers who have been working 
with pseudo-3D on the PlayStation, are now finding themselves playing 
catch-up working in real 3D on the PlayStation 2. In that sense, I think
 the PlayStation 2 is even harder to develop for than the Nintendo 
64.&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo 64 weeded out weaker developers at an early stage</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>In the long term, I think that was necessary.</strong>&nbsp;Almost a rite of passage.”</p>
<p><a title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-reflects-on-history-for-dolphin-2448541" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-reflects-on-history-for-dolphin-2448541">Shigeru Miyamoto believed</a>&nbsp;that
 developers who have grown comfortable creating Nintendo 64 software 
won’t find Dolphin difficult to develop. &nbsp;Due to the GameCube’s 
power, he didn’t think developers would have to put in so much work into
 creating special effects like the Nintendo 64. &nbsp;Instead of dealing
 with difficult hardware, developers could spend more energy into the 
actual projects.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto said, “When the transition from one platform to 
another is occurring, the technology is different and everything is 
difficult as far as new technology is concerned. Having said that, there
 should be some advantage to making games for Nintendo’s new platform 
because when Nintendo 64 launched to the market it was already the next 
next-generation system. In other words, Nintendo 64 already realized a 
complete 3D technology when it was shifted 
from&nbsp;Super&nbsp;Nintendo.&nbsp;So, those<strong>&nbsp;developers 
who have already created good software for Nintendo 64 are already in a 
stage where they will be able to produce good software for Dolphin. 
&nbsp;</strong>In the case of Nintendo 64, we have to be very 
experienced. We have to have full knowledge in what will be able to run 
on the console. When it comes to Dolphin, it’s so powerful that we don’t
 have to put so much energy in making some special effects and 
sophisticated movement. In other words, we can put priority on the 
realization of our own game ideas, rather than trying to make some 
special effect work.”</p>

<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Genyo Takeda, director
 and general manager of Nintendo, understood that there was a cultural 
divide between Nintendo and the engineers at Silicon Valley. &nbsp;But 
since many of the ArtX designers were former members of Silicon 
Graphics, the culture clash between the two companies would be smoothed 
over, and they worked toward the goal of succeeding with Dolphin where 
they failed with Nintendo 64.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Takeda believed that no one standout technology should dominate the Dolphin’s hardware. Instead, <a title="http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1224761" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1224761">he asked</a> ArtX, IBM, and Nintendo to create well-balanced technology that worked together in harmony with each other.</span></p>
<p>“The most difficult issue in the Dolphin project was the gap between 
the technology-driven culture in Silicon Valley and our intention to 
pursue entertainment. It was most difficult to ask Valley engineers to 
swallow their pride,” said Takeda in <a title="http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1224761" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1224761">an interview</a>
 with the eetimes. “Through discussion, we could establish a good 
relationship with them because the partners in Silicon Valley are mostly
 the same members who worked for Nintendo 64. We told them, ‘Let’s 
achieve what we could not do with Nintendo 64”</p>
<p>Howard Cheng, technical director at Nintendo Technology Development, 
was an SGI engineer who collaborated on Nintendo 64 development and then
 joined Nintendo a few years later. Cheng worked as the liaison between 
Nintendo and Silicon Valley engineers.</p>
<p>“Takeda gave me a very simple requirement, to make a high-performance
 machine that game developers can effectively work with,” Cheng said. 
“That itself is very difficult to ask as the speed of the processor and 
everything is so fast today. Balancing everything is very tricky, and it
 has to have a good price for consumers. That continues to be most 
challenging.”</p>
<p>Greg Buchner said ArtX and Nintendo worked on Dolphin [GameCube] for 
over three years to figure out what should be the main priorities in 
helping developers create software. &nbsp;The most important priority 
was to create a high performance machine that would fight the rising 
costs of game development.</p>
<p>“We thought about the developers as our main customers. In particular
 for GameCube, we spent three years working with Nintendo of America and
 with all sorts of developers, trying to understand the challenges, 
needs, and problems they face,” said Buchner. &nbsp;He further 
elaborates, “First among these is the rising cost of development. The 
GameCube can see high performance without too much trouble; it isn’t a 
quirky design, but a very clean one. It was important we didn’t require 
jumping through hoops for high performance to be achieved. On top of 
that, it is rich in features, and we worked to include a dream group of 
technical features that developers requested.”</p>
<p>ArtX kept notes of what developers liked or disliked about 
programming for the PlayStation (PS One). Since the PlayStation was 
originally planned as a collaboration between Sony and Nintendo, 
Nintendo already had an understanding of how Sony’s engineers approached
 console design. &nbsp;ArtX had also <a title="http://thegia.com/archive/features/f010606.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://thegia.com/archive/features/f010606.html">received information</a>
 on the PlayStation 2’s architecture before Sony even made their 
console’s specs public. Another mistake Sony made was going public with 
their specs and architecture one year before the PS2’s launch. This 
would give ArtX even more time to analyze the PlayStation 2’s flaws.</p>
<p>“The GameCube [Dolphin] has been made from scratch, and is a very new
 architecture and design, but we certainly looked at what had gone well 
and what hadn’t for the PlayStation. There is a long history of working 
with Nintendo and their legacy, plus we got an inkling of how 
PlayStation 2 was going to be. &nbsp;We drew from all those different 
consoles in terms of what was right and the direction we should go, what
 directions we should avoid. With that said, it wasn’t like we copied 
anything,” said Buchner.</p>
<p>Buncher continued, “They [Sony] went public with what the PS2 was 
going to be spec-wise and architecture-wise about a year before the 
product launched, which is a long time. &nbsp;When we saw their design, 
it really validated to us that we had made the right choice and done 
something different and efficient. They [Sony] made some mistakes in the
 architecture, and it made us feel good about what we had created.” 
&nbsp;He later adds, “From a very high level, going from the PlayStation
 to the PS2, they made it harder to develop for. With the GameCube 
[Dolphin], we made it much easier to work with than the Nintendo 64. 
From a development point of view, it looks like they went in the 
opposite direction we went, and that isn’t good.”</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto <a title="http://www.angelfire.com/sd/gamecube/news/001.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.angelfire.com/sd/gamecube/news/001.html">heard from developers</a> that Sony had created a console that was more difficult to make games for than the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>“Well, of course I’ve never worked on the PS2 hardware, so I really 
don’t know, but what I’ve heard from many different people is that they 
have somehow created a machine that is even more difficult to make games
 for than the N64. In terms of the Gamecube, we have created the 
hardware so that it’s much easier to program for than N64, and yet we 
can guarantee several dozens of times better performance than N64. 
&nbsp;In other words, Gamecube is probably far superior to the PS2 in 
terms of the friendliness for game developers,” said Miyamoto</p>
<p>To ensure that GameCube was more developer friendly, Nintendo brought
 developers on board to help influence the hardware’s design. &nbsp;One 
of those developers <a title="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/169389/interviews/creative-minds/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/169389/interviews/creative-minds/">was Martin Hollis</a>, the director of Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark for the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>“My responsibilities were chiefly to advise on the development of 
GameCube at Nintendo Technology Development Inc. (NTD). This little 
known group was newly created to architect and direct the development of
 GameCube hardware and associated software. My role was to bring the 
point of view of a game developer to the table, and to ensure the 
hardware was game developer friendly,” said Hollis. &nbsp;“The 
experience was fascinating, as I have always loved hardware and enjoyed 
having a full and deep understanding of what is going on under the hood.
 The chance to influence and to learn more about hardware design was 
very exciting. I learned an enormous amount from Howard Cheng in that 
era, especially on the subject of high level architecture and console 
design strategy.</p>
<p>ArtX <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/18/interview-ibm-details-gekko-part-ii" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/18/interview-ibm-details-gekko-part-ii">spent most of 1998</a>
 figuring out what the Flipper chip needed to be, and by 1999, they 
cranked out the silicon and produced the first part of the chip. 
&nbsp;In 2000, the final silicon was ready for production, and it was 
shown at Spaceworld 2000 along with various tech demos.</p>

<p>At Nintendo’s Kyoto headquarters,&nbsp;Ashida Kenichiro and his team 
were busy designing the overall look of the Dolphin. &nbsp;At a 
roundtable,&nbsp;<a title="http://senseinaga.tripod.com/cube/news/7.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://senseinaga.tripod.com/cube/news/7.html">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>&nbsp;said
 the goal was to create a system that looked like the ultimate gaming 
system, and not another piece of audio/visual hardware that would sit on
 a shelf and not move. Studies revealed that most Japanese families 
preferred smaller electronics in their household, and these discoveries 
lead to a small, compact, and efficient design.</p>
<p>Kenichiro explained in <a title="http://gcelite.tripod.com/Focus.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://gcelite.tripod.com/Focus.html">an old interview</a>, “At first, I proposed several ideas that were less tall and more wide than what you see now. &nbsp;<strong>One of the early ideas looked something like a UFO.</strong>&nbsp;
 These designs weren’t working very well, so I took a close look at how 
real game players and there game systems interact. I wanted to make the 
Nintendo GameCube fit well into a user-friendly environment. The cube 
shape gives the impression of very compact, especially when you see it 
sitting on the floor. I like the simple, polished look of the final 
design.”</p>
<p>The company discovered that many gamers became personally attached to
 their consoles. &nbsp;They would take their consoles over to a friend’s
 house to play, or they would move their console from one room to 
another. Nintendo decided to include a handle on the GameCube to give it
 portability and a more personal, friendly look.</p>
<p>“Before I started thinking about the design of the Nintendo GameCube,
 I did some research to determine how video game systems were used in 
game players’ homes. &nbsp;I discovered that a lot of players actually 
moved the console away from the television and closer to themselves 
while playing games. &nbsp;Adding the handle to the system makes it 
easier for players to do this, and it also gives the system a friendly 
look,” said Kenichiro.</p>
<p>Miyamoto also added,&nbsp;<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">“GameCube’s
 design is pretty peculiar, different from what we are in the habit to 
see in a gaming console. First thing we had in mind was the evolution of
 videogaming itself: the reduced size of the GameCube allows you to 
carry it from room to room quite easily. Every family has at least two 
TV-sets at home, and it is very easy to bring the GameCube from the 
living-room to the sleeping-room, if you want, not to consider a 
friend’s place. We looked for simplicity and practicalness: GameCube 
wants to be a console that fits all the family, from the youngsters to 
the elders.”</span></p>
<p>Another issue brought up at the Kyoto headquarters was deciding which
 colors to launch their console with. Nintendo conducted studies on a 
wide variety of colors ranging from lime green to bright pink.&nbsp;They
 found that black was much more popular in the United States while 
countries like Japan preferred indigo and orange.</p>
<p>“One of the colors we’re using for GameCube is Indigo, which was 
adopted from a color found in the Nintendo GameCube logotype. We are 
aware, however, that people have a wide range of likes and dislikes when
 it comes to color,” said Kenichiro. “We did alot of research, and found
 that many people wanted to see a Jet (black) version of Nintendo 
GameCube. We are releasing that both in Japan and the U.S. In order to 
appeal to a wider audience in Japan, we released a Spice (orange) 
version as well.”</p>
<p>As the hardware’s development was being finalized, there was a debate
 over what the name of the console should be. &nbsp;Shigeru Miyamoto <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5399" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5399">pushed for the name</a>
 “Dolphin” to be the console’s official name, but not everyone supported
 this idea.”I am of the opinion that the dolphin can be the actual 
official name of the product, but some people disagree,” said Shigeru 
Miyamoto.</p>
<p>A website named TendoBox did some investigating in the U.S. trademark
 database where they discovered that Nintendo registered the name 
“StarCube” three times. &nbsp;The similarities between the Nintendo 64 
logo and the Star Cube logo were pretty striking. The official Nintendo 
website of Sweden posted information about “StarCube”, but Nintendo of 
America and Japan wouldn’t confirm anything.</p>
<p>According to the <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/guide/1749" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/guide/1749">official Nintendo website of Sweden</a>,
 “Sources from Nintendo in Japan have now confirmed that Nintendo’s new 
videogame console, earlier called Project Dolphin, will be named 
Starcube. The network, over which you will be able to play against 
people all over the world, will be named Star Road. Much more about 
Starcube and Star Road will be presented at Spaceworld August 24-27.”</p>
<p>When Nintendo of America executives, Perrin Kaplan and Jim Merrick, 
were asked about the Starcube name, they both denied ever hearing of the
 name.</p>
<p>“Yeah, there was a lot of debate. We really wanted something that 
reinforced the design and defined the system really well. There was a 
lot of debate. I don’t remember ‘Starcube’ coming up, but there were a 
lot of other possibilities,” said Merrick.</p>
<p>Perrin Kaplan told IGN that the name “GameCube” was a collaborative effort between Nintendo of Japan and Nintendo of America.</p>
<p>“There was really a lot of effort on both sides”, said Kaplan. “And 
Nintendo Japan really took a lot of time with the name. NOA and Japan 
were involved with the logo design and everything.”</p>

<h1><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Motion Controls….and GameCube?</span></h1>
<p>In an <a title="http://www.nintengen.com/2006/02/sega-predicted-revolution-way-back-in.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintengen.com/2006/02/sega-predicted-revolution-way-back-in.html">interview with MCV Magazine</a>,
 Greg Thomas,&nbsp;Sega of America’s VP of Development, said he believed
 Dolphin would be a bigger threat to the Dreamcast than PlayStation 2 or
 Xbox. &nbsp;Sega heard rumblings that Nintendo was working on a secret 
“sensory controller” for the Dolphin.</p>
<p>“I don’t care how many polygons X-Box can put out,” Thomas said. 
“It’s all about who can deliver the next great gameplay experience. I’m 
not nervous about X-Box or PlayStation2, because we think we can make 
better games. No one will have head-to-head Internet play but us. <strong>What
 does worry me is Dolphin’s sensory controllers [which are rumored to 
include microphones and headphone jacks] because there’s an example of 
someone thinking about something different.”</strong></p>
<p>Another developer who spoke on the GameCube’s [Dolphin’s] motion 
controls was Julian Eggebrecht, the CEO of Factor 5. Factor 5 played a 
prominent role with the development of the GameCube’s hardware and 
tools. They helped create middleware such as DivX and MusyX for the 
console, and they were one of the first developers to receive Dolphin 
development kits.</p>
<p>Julian Eggebrecht&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a title="http://e-mpire.com/showthread.php/75652-Factor-5-worked-with-GameCube-motion-controller" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://e-mpire.com/showthread.php/75652-Factor-5-worked-with-GameCube-motion-controller">Factor 5 received early prototypes of a GameCube controller with motion controls</a>
 as they developed Rogue Leader. This would line up with the quote from 
Sega of America’s VP of Development who talked about Dolphin having 
“sensory controllers”.</p>
<p>“When we were doing Star Wars: Rogue Leader for the GameCube 
actually, we had an early prototype of that controller, and that had 
motion control. So we thought our style of gameplay – especially when it
 comes to flight – about motion control for a long time, so we were kind
 of anticipating it, and I was always keeping it in the back of my 
head,” said Eggebrecht.</p>
<p>The biggest misconception is that Nintendo moved to motion controls 
due to the GameCube’s failures, but Nintendo was interested in motion 
controls as soon as the GameCube launched.&nbsp;In September 24th, 2001,
 the same month GameCube launched in Japan, Nintendo <a title="http://www.gamecubicle.com/news-nintendo_gyration.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamecubicle.com/news-nintendo_gyration.htm">licensed two US application Patents</a>
 from a company called Gyration that deal with tracking human motion and

&nbsp;During that month, Gyration had pitched some GyroPad prototypes to
 Nintendo’s executives, which you can see a few pictures below <a title="http://gizmodo.com/294642/unearthed-nintendos-pre+wiimote-prototype" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://gizmodo.com/294642/unearthed-nintendos-pre+wiimote-prototype">provided by Gizmodo</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When CVG’s Rob Crossely <a title="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/378029/features/revolution-the-story-of-wii/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/378029/features/revolution-the-story-of-wii/">asked a Gyration employee</a> about Julian’s comments, he said his company never made any gyroscope accessory for the GameCube.</p>

<p>Although Gyration says their company never worked on any motion 
controllers or add-on’s for GameCube, it’s interesting to note that 
there’s been many patents filed regarding motion controls for GameCube.</p>
<p>In a <a title="https://www.google.com/patents/US6908388?dq=6,908,388&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VzrGUu7oAeeBygGO94HQCw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.google.com/patents/US6908388?dq=6,908,388&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VzrGUu7oAeeBygGO94HQCw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA">patent filed in 2003</a>,
 pictures show how you can use either a Game Boy Advance (Fig. 1) or a 
GameCube controller (fig. 17) &nbsp;to create motion (tilting a world or
 tilting characters).</p>
<p>The patent says, “In this conventional technique, when a handheld game device <strong>or a game controller</strong>
 (hereinafter, referred to as “a game device, etc.” in place of “a 
handheld game device or a game controller”) is tilted, a game image is 
generated in which an object such as a player character, etc., moves 
(rolls over) in the direction of tilt, thereby allowing a player to feel
 as if a game space is actually tilted in accordance with a tilt of the 
game device, etc.”</p>
<p>A <a title="https://www.google.com/patents/US8348734?dq=inassignee:%22Nintendo+Co.,+Ltd.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LVfGUqHZMsrQyAHXrYHICw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBDi-AQ" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.google.com/patents/US8348734?dq=inassignee:%22Nintendo+Co.,+Ltd.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LVfGUqHZMsrQyAHXrYHICw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBDi-AQ">patent with a priority date of 2004</a> and a filing date of 2005 <strong>shows a GameCube controller</strong> (not a Wii remote) being used as a motion controller for Wii Sports.</p>
<p>The patent explains, “A game system for executing a sport game in 
which a player character and an opponent character rally a hit object in
 a virtual game space, comprising:&nbsp;<strong>a movement controller configured to move the player character in the virtual game space</strong> in accordance with an operation by a player;&nbsp;<strong>a moving amount detector</strong>
 configured to detect the player character’s moving amount per 
predetermined unit time at each predetermined time interval;&nbsp;an 
adder configured to add the player character’s moving amount per 
predetermined unit time for accumulation;<strong> and&nbsp;a motion controller configured to control the motion of the player character</strong>
 so as to provide the player with the option of instructing the player 
character to perform a hitting motion of a first type and to prohibit 
the player from instructing the player character to perform a hitting 
motion of a second type, different from the first type, when a result of
 addition by the adder does not exceed a predetermined value, and so as 
to provide the player with the option of instructing the player 
character to perform the hitting motion of the first type or the hitting
 motion of the second type when a result of addition by the adder 
exceeds the predetermined value.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This information is not to discredit 
Gyration’s claims that there was never a motion controller in 
development for GameCube. Obviously, the company was working very 
closely with Nintendo on the Wii remote’s technology. The purpose of 
this information is meant to explain why some people believe there was a
 motion controller in development for the GameCube. Remember, we didn’t 
even know that GameCube was <a title="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98097-Nintendo-Built-3D-Into-the-Gamecube" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98097-Nintendo-Built-3D-Into-the-Gamecube">designed with 3D stereoscopic capabilities</a> until 2011, so you never know what experiments were going on at NCL during the GameCube days.

<p>Reactions to the Nintendo 64′s controller were mixed — it received 
praise for revolutionizing controls for 3D movement, but it was also 
criticized for being too large and uncomfortable.&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/28/mr-miyamoto-speaks" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/28/mr-miyamoto-speaks">Speaking to the press</a>&nbsp;in
 1999, Shigeru Miyamoto said, “The major problem is that the Japanese 
user says that the N64 controller is too big and the American user says 
it’s the appropriate size.”</p>
<p>The common belief was that Shigeru Miyamoto designed Nintendo 64′s 
controller around “Super Mario 64″, and many wondered if GameCube’s 
controller followed a similar development path. &nbsp;Nintendo’s Jim 
Merrick&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/13/interviewing-nintendos-jedi-council-2&quot;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/13/interviewing-nintendos-jedi-council-2%22">shot down</a>&nbsp;any speculation that Miyamoto designed GameCube’s controller around a single game.</p>
<p>“No, and I think that’s a misnomer to say that the N64 controller was
 designed around Super Mario 64. Yes, Mr. Miyamoto wanted analog control
 because he had a vision of how he wanted that game to work, but the 
controller wasn’t designed specifically for one game,” said Merrick.</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata, Nintendo’s director of planning (at the time), spoke to
 Japanese magazine nDream about the GameCube. &nbsp;Iwata told the 
magazine that their obsessison with creating and redesigning controllers
 is why their controllers receive so much praise.</p>
<p>Miyamoto devoted&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/29/miyamoto-roundtable" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/29/miyamoto-roundtable">more time and energy</a>&nbsp;into
 the GameCube’s controller than any of Nintendo’s previous controllers. 
&nbsp;The NES controller was the first controller to add a D-Pad, the 
SNES controller would be the first to add shoulder buttons, and Nintendo
 64′s controller introduced the analogue stick.&nbsp;How would Miyamoto 
be able to top his previous three achievements? &nbsp;For starters, 
Shigeru Miyamoto’s new mission was to completely reinvent the shape and 
feel of the controller so anyone — young or old, with big or small hands
 — could comfortably hold it.</p>
<p>“This Gamecube controller is&nbsp;<strong>the one on which I spent the longest time on designing</strong>. As far as controller designs are concerned, I think that this is the&nbsp;<strong>fourth or fifth version since the original design,”&nbsp;</strong>said Miyamoto.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;”</strong>Our
 target user for this controller is not very specific, it’s very 
general, as even a beginner who has never touched the controller can use
 it, your grandmother can use, or even children with small hands can use
 it. I think it’s&nbsp;<strong>already three years or so since I first started working on this controller design.</strong>&nbsp;I
 don’t know if any of you are a developer for the Gamecube, but if you 
are, you are going to receive the development tools pretty soon, 
and&nbsp;the controller included with the tools is already different 
from the one that shall be the final version that will go to market.”</p>
<p>Over the span of three years, the GameCube controller dramatically 
evolved with ideas being added and removed on a monthly basis. 
&nbsp;Miyamoto, like any artist, wanted to top himself by creating 
something better than his previous work. &nbsp;For example, the ‘B’ 
button was originally kidney shaped like the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ buttons, but 
the shape would later change to being small and round.</p>
<p>Saturu Iwata said,&nbsp;”I’m frankly pretty surprised at the number 
of changes we’ve made to this controller [laughs]. I think that it 
really contains a lot of the DNA of Nintendo, if you will. &nbsp;And I 
think that Nintendo puts a lot more emphasis and uses the controller 
more than any of the other companies.”</p>
<p>Miyamoto’s first idea&nbsp;<a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/7019" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/7019">was to reinvent</a>&nbsp;the traditional placement of the A,B,X, Y buttons that had become standard in the industry.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to appear self-important, but I was the first to put 
four buttons on the right hand of the pad, when I designed the Super NES
 controller and Sega, Sony and now even Microsoft have followed that 
idea. I don’t want to state they copied from us, but it is obvious that 
the four buttons became a standard.&nbsp;<strong>Now I have decided to&nbsp;renounce&nbsp;this shape. &nbsp;I invented it and I can afford to renounce it.&nbsp;</strong>(smiles),” said Miyamoto.</p>
<p>The GameCube’s controller would place a far greater emphasis on 
having a “main” button, a large green button surrounded by smaller 
buttons. &nbsp;The sizes, shapes, and positions of each button would 
help players identify each button’s level of importance on the 
controller’s layout.</p>
<p>Miyamoto&nbsp;<a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/7019" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/7019">explained</a>,
 “I wanted to focus on the immediate recognition of the main button on 
the joypad. &nbsp;In SNES it was the “A” button, in the GameCube, it is 
the green one. It is pleasant to the touch and the player is immediately
 aware what button is the most important one, the main control between 
him and what permits him to interact, for example, with Mario. ”</p>
<p>It would be designed as a culmination of his past ideas from previous
 controllers, but instead of every single button being round, many of 
the buttons were kidney-shaped for more intuitive controls.</p>
<p><b>“</b>Well, the whole idea was to be able to feel them [kidney 
shaped buttons] with your eyes closed and have them more intuitive 
versus everything always being round,” said Perrin Kaplan,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1">when asked</a>&nbsp;about the controller’s unusual button layout.</p>
<p>As the GameCube controller went through various changes, Miyamoto had&nbsp;<a title="http://spong.com/article/2145/Nintendo-Elvis-Talks-of-GameCube-Controller-and-Possibly-a-Mario-and-Luigi-Team-Up" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/2145/Nintendo-Elvis-Talks-of-GameCube-Controller-and-Possibly-a-Mario-and-Luigi-Team-Up">hinted at the possibility</a>&nbsp;of
 dropping the D-Pad altogether. “We had to fine tune many aspects of the
 controller, but the basic layout and design hasn’t changed. The real 
differences have been the sizes and placement of the buttons.” said 
Miyamoto. “We wanted the perfect design and I think we nearly achieved 
that. In the future,&nbsp;perhaps we won’t need the cross button 
[D-Pad].”</p>
<p>IGN&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/16/d-pad-a-go" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/16/d-pad-a-go">wrote an article</a>&nbsp;claiming their sources had seen early&nbsp;<i>prototypes</i>&nbsp;of
 the controller without a D-Pad. After writing the article, they spoke 
to more developers working on Dolphin hardware, and one developer told 
the website,&nbsp;”I don’t know where [the D-Pad] is going to be, but 
they’re going to stick it on there somewhere now.”</p>
<p>“To this we say, “Buh?” Was the D-Pad a go all along or is this some 
new development?,” wrote IGN. “We’re not sure. One thing is for certain,
 though –&nbsp;as of last month, developers were still telling us that 
there was absolutely not going to be a D-Pad on the Dolphin controller<b>,</b>&nbsp;which leads us to believe that&nbsp;Nintendo decided to go ahead with one in the eleventh hour.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine a Nintendo controller without a D-Pad, but this 
almost happened with the GameCube. Did Shigeru Miyamoto believe that the
 shift from 2D to 3D gaming would make D-Pads irrelevant? Unfortunately,
 when the D-Pad was added to the controller, it&nbsp;felt like an 
afterthought instead of a priority. Similar in size to Game Boy 
Advance’s tiny D-Pad, the D-Pad was awkwardly placed on the GameCube’s 
controller, and it seemed obvious that Nintendo ran out of ideas on 
where to put it.</p>
<p>Ashida Kenichiro, one of Nintendo’s hardware designers on the GameCube,&nbsp;<a title="http://gcelite.tripod.com/Focus.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://gcelite.tripod.com/Focus.html">said the controller</a>&nbsp;was
 designed to make you forget that you are holding a controller. 
&nbsp;But it was challenging to incorporate so many features into the 
controller while keeping it comfortable.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, the ideal controller is one which the player forgets 
he is even holding. &nbsp;It was very difficult to accomplish this task 
with the Gamecube controller, because we wanted to incorporate so many 
features into it. &nbsp;From the beginning to end of the project I kept 
asking myself, “How can I arrange the features comfortably?,” said 
Kenichiro.</p>
<p>Miyamoto felt that he had succeeded in creating a controller that was
 superior to the Nintendo 64′s controller, but he also believed the 
GameCube controller would&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-super_mario_sunshine.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-super_mario_sunshine.htm">set a new standard</a>&nbsp;for future game controllers from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>“I had some confidence with the N64 controller, too. However, when I 
compare the two, I can tell that the GCN Controller is better designed 
for game play. What I really want to say is,<em>&nbsp;“</em>Get accustomed to the GCN Controller because,&nbsp;<strong>10 years from now, this controller will be the standard</strong>“&nbsp;said Miyamoto.</p>
<p>At E3 2001, months before launch, Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=978392" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=978392">mentioned</a>&nbsp;that
 Miyamoto still planned to tweak the controller’s C-stick before 
release. Nintendo’s engineers worked around the clock to sneak in 
Miyamoto’s final requests before Japan’s launch in September.</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata explains, “But [Miyamoto] mentioned earlier that he’s still&nbsp;<strong>not totally happy with the feel of the c-stick</strong>&nbsp;and
 he’s still working on it and it will probably change again.&nbsp;But 
the hardware team is intent that the one we’re showing at E3 (2001) is 
the final one. &nbsp;But because Mr. Miyamoto has asked for this final 
change and we do want to get this in the final product, the hardware 
team is back at home working very hard to make sure that they get it 
done in time and from my opinion, it looks as though everything is going
 well. Obviously, when we make prototypes at Nintendo, we then pass 
those along for everybody to comment on and give their input on. And as 
Mr. Miyamoto is known to do, he likes to continue to make his changes 
and maximize all the functions of the controller, even up to the very 
last minute at which point we’ve got our hardware people scrambling to 
get his changes in [laughs]. &nbsp;I think it’s because of this 
perfectionist attitude that Mr. Miyamoto has and the kind of last minute
 changes he makes to improve the controller is part of the reason why 
people really feel that Nintendo controllers have the best feel and are 
very easy to use.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years after the GameCube released, Shigeru Miyamoto viewed GameCube’s
 controller from a more critical perspective. &nbsp;Although Miyamoto 
was happy with the controller’s final design, he&nbsp;<a title="http://cube.gamespy.com/articles/636/636728p2.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://cube.gamespy.com/articles/636/636728p2.html">didn’t believe</a>&nbsp;it was absolutely perfect.&nbsp;The clickable L and R buttons seemed innovative at the time, but Miyamoto&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamespot.com/unions/zelda/forums/22487419/miyamoto-on-revolution-controller-must-be-usable-for-a-zelda-type-game." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/unions/zelda/forums/22487419/miyamoto-on-revolution-controller-must-be-usable-for-a-zelda-type-game.">seemed disappointed</a>&nbsp;that they didn’t use the functionality for more unique ideas.</p>
<p>“Using the analog and the L and R shoulder buttons was maybe a little
 hard for the younger players. We were not able to use that 
functionality very well in games either. On this next one [Revolution], 
we’re really looking at solving some of those problems,” said 
Miyamoto.&nbsp;“With the GameCube, we originally thought we’d be able to
 use the functionality of the L and R buttons to create some really 
unique things. In the end we just made basic games and didn’t really 
utilize the full potential, but with the Revolution we’re hoping to do 
is utilize the interface to create more interesting and unique games.”</p>
<p>Miyamoto&nbsp;<a title="http://www.1up.com/news/miyamoto-talks-future" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.1up.com/news/miyamoto-talks-future">was asked</a>&nbsp;if
 any specific game stuck with him after all of these years. 
&nbsp;Miyamoto replied, “It’s not a game, but maybe the GameCube’s 
controller. We made it as a culmination of everything leading up to it, 
but it really underwhelmed. ‘This line of thinking doesn’t give us 
anything else to shoot for, does it?’ That’s how I felt.”</p>
<p>When asked for more specifics, Miyamoto admitted that the Gamecube 
controller lead to the creation of the Wii remote. “The GameCube 
controller is a product of us feeling that, without this or that, people
 wouldn’t be able to play the games we make. But then we realized that 
was a problem, that we were thinking based on that controller as the 
premise.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Miyamoto who would look back at the GameCube’s 
controller with a different perspective. Ashida Kenichiro&nbsp;, one of 
the lead designers of the GameCube’s controller, said&nbsp;<a title="http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/wii_remote/0/0" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/wii_remote/0/0">he felt incompatible</a>&nbsp;with the GameCube controller over the years.</p>
<p>“I personally felt that the GameCube controller was the culmination 
of all controllers that had come before it, and that it couldn’t be 
improved via the traditional concept of simply adding to it. More than 
anything else, I felt as though the controller and I were incompatible. 
Having a family, the time I had to play hard games decreased, and a gap 
between my “creator self” and my “player self” was born,” said 
Kenichiro.</p>

<p>According to the book&nbsp;<em>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761537082/finalfantasyx-20" target="_blank">Opening the Xbox</a>: Inside Microsoft’s Plan to Unleash an Entertainment Revolution”</em>,
 Microsoft was ready to spend $25 billion for the Japanese game giant. 
Nintendo’s U.S. president Minoru Arakawa wasn’t sure what to think when 
Microsoft made the offer. “I was surprised,” Arakawa admitted. “We 
didn’t need the money. I thought it was a joke.”</p>
<p>Arakawa and Nintendo of America still&nbsp;<a title="http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EpkppFVAZAjBjGvsNN.php" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EpkppFVAZAjBjGvsNN.php" target="_blank">took the offer seriously</a>&nbsp;and
 brought discussions to its corporate office in Japan. “Some Nintendo 
executives seemed interested and the meetings went on through the 
winter,” the book describes. “The parties met six or seven times. 
Microsoft wanted Nintendo to drop its GameCube console and get behind 
the Xbox. But Hiroshi Yamauchi, the aging CEO and Nintendo, didn’t like 
the idea. By January 2000, the talks were over.”</p>
<p>The<a title="http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EpkppFVAZAjBjGvsNN.php" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EpkppFVAZAjBjGvsNN.php" target="_blank">&nbsp;two companies parted ways&nbsp;</a>and
 wished each other luck. “Our ability to remain independent was 
unquestioned due to our financial status,” explained Arakawa. “And it 
became clear that our objectives and their objectives were not the 
same.” &nbsp;Microsoft said the door would remain open if Nintendo ever 
considered changing their mind. In&nbsp;German magazine&nbsp;<i>Wirtschafts Woche,&nbsp;</i>founder and chairman Bill Gates&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/04/bill-gates-wants-to-buy-nintendo" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/04/bill-gates-wants-to-buy-nintendo" target="_blank">expressed interest in buying game giant Nintendo</a>&nbsp;should
 the company put itself on the market.&nbsp;“If Hiroshi Yamauchi calls, 
he will be directly transferred to me,” said Gates.</p>
<p>“It would be a great investment,” said Perrin Kaplan, vice president 
of marketing and corporate affairs for Nintendo. “We’re a very 
successful company. &nbsp;But the bad news for Mr. Gates is we’re not 
for sale.”</p>
<p>Yamauchi had a great deal of respect for Bill Gates, but he&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/30/nintendo-boss-cleans-gates-clock" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/30/nintendo-boss-cleans-gates-clock">did not believe</a>&nbsp;Microsoft understood the game business or Japanese gamers.</p>
<p>“Everyone agrees that Bill Gates is a great businessman,”<em>&nbsp;</em>Hiroshi<em>&nbsp;</em>Yamauchi said<em>,&nbsp;</em>“but
 he’s only human. There is one thing he knows nothing about, and that’s 
games. &nbsp;If you know nothing about sumo, you can’t expect to take on
 a Yokozuna…I expect even in a year’s time they’ll be able to see the 
consequences of this.”</p>
<p>In a separate interview, Yamauchi&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/03/yamauchi-on-the-record" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/03/yamauchi-on-the-record">slammed Microsoft’s intentions</a>&nbsp;of
 entering the game industry.&nbsp;“There are a lot of people who really 
do not know about games in the industry. Especially one big company in 
the USA thinks that it can use a lot of money to surround itself with 
software companies and accomplish what Nintendo has done.”<em>&nbsp;</em>said Nintendo President, Hiroshi Yamauchi.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>“We
 don’t think it will go that easily. It seems that they will be bringing
 their system out next year, and the results of how well they actually 
do will be known to us in the beginning of the following year.”</p>
<p>Hiroshi Yamauchi also&nbsp;<a title="http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/crontab/t-5575.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/crontab/t-5575.html" target="_blank">shot down comparisons</a>&nbsp;between what Nintendo and Microsoft are offering.</p>
<p>“Microsoft is going after performance only, and does not understand 
that the game is played with software. A Nintendo is ultimately a toy. 
It is the most advanced machine for playing games, and it is totally 
different from the Microsoft product. It is just like trying to compare a
 sumo wrestler and pro-wrestler; they play by totally different rules. 
We do not consider Microsoft to be our competitor,” said Yamauchi.</p>
<p>Yamauchi&nbsp;<a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881">explained</a>&nbsp;to
 an interviewer,&nbsp;“I don’t think the Xbox will do very well in 
Japan. The same old genres and development methods still work in 
America, but they won’t interest the more discriminating gamers of 
Japan. The PS2 was just discounted too, but I can’t expect that will 
have much of an effect.”</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata, Nintendo’s Director of Planning in 2001, <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/05/interview-satoru-iwata-3" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/05/interview-satoru-iwata-3">criticized Microsoft</a>
 for focusing more attention on their marketing budget than actual 
software. &nbsp;In his opinion, a true entertainment company understands
 that marketing doesn’t work if the product is undesirable.</p>
<p>Iwata said, “What really showed me that they [Microsoft] don’t have 
the experience in the entertainment industry is that they started off by
 announcing the $500 million marketing amount. So that’s what they’re 
going to go with and that’s a big number and of course it’s great 
because it got them in the news. But our philosophy is that you don’t 
start off with a number of what you’re going to market something with. 
Rather, you look at the product, you look at the entertainment and what 
you’re trying to package and what you want it to be. Then you think 
about the best way to convey that to the consumer. That’s what 
entertainment is about and that’s why we don’t go in for those types of 
tactics. If you come up with a product that people don’t want, it 
doesn’t matter how much money you spend, they’re still not going to want
 it. &nbsp;We don’t necessarily agree with how they’ve gone about doing 
things so far and don’t think it’s for us.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After selling 100 million consoles, “PlayStation” had quickly become a
 well recognized brand name around the world. &nbsp;In 1999, Sony 
announced the PlayStation 2, and they promised that this system would 
change everyone’s lives forever. &nbsp;They positioned the PS2 as a 
“multi-media computer entertainment system” and they told the media that
 Sega and Nintendo were only interested in making toys.</p>
<p>“The new system is not just a technology upgrade,” said Kaz Hirai, 
president and chief operating officer of&nbsp;Sony Computer 
Entertainment of America Inc. “These are not just next-generation 
consoles but the vision of the next (big thing) in home entertainment. 
We have developed the most advanced entertainment platform in the 
world.”</p>
<p>Sony portrayed the Sega’s Dreamcast as a minor upgrade that wasn’t 
built for the future, and they told customers that the next generation 
wouldn’t arrive until the launch of PlayStation 2. &nbsp;Sony’s 
executives did everything they could to hype up the capabilities of the 
PS2. &nbsp;They <a title="http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1230000" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1230000">even bragged</a>
 about how their workstations were being surpassed by the PlayStation 2.
 The media reported how PlayStation 2 was so powerful that Iraq was 
buying them&nbsp;<a title="http://www.wnd.com/2000/12/7640/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.wnd.com/2000/12/7640/">to use for military operations</a>.</p>
<p>Phil Harrison, former vice president of SCEA,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.zdnet.com/news/sony-dreamcast-half-of-playstation-2/103238" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.zdnet.com/news/sony-dreamcast-half-of-playstation-2/103238">told the press</a>,”Being half our price is indicative of the fact that they [Sega] are&nbsp;<strong>less than half our technology</strong>. This delivers a future proof element to our technology. It is many years ahead of its time.”</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Nintendo was planning to make a strong comeback 
and unseat Sony from it’s dominant position. Unfortunately, Nintendo 
would have quite a mountain to climb if they wanted to be the top dog 
again. Hiroshi Yamauchi’s policies in the 1990’s lead many third parties
 to rally behind Sony and abandon their support for Nintendo. 
&nbsp;However, even after the success of the first PlayStation, Yamauchi
 remained adamant about his position on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>“I’ve been told that Sony won over Nintendo by surrounding itself 
with software companies, and I will admit that situation was there in 
the past. However, times have changed, and it’s&nbsp;no longer a race to
 see how many useless companies you can get on your side.”&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/yamauchi-remarks-on-the-next-generation-console-race-2649929" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/news/yamauchi-remarks-on-the-next-generation-console-race-2649929">said Yamauchi.</a></p>
<p>After the PlayStation 2 had launched in Japan, Hiroshi Yamauchi&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/08/yamauchi-confirms-dolphin-delay-internet-plans" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/08/yamauchi-confirms-dolphin-delay-internet-plans">criticized</a>&nbsp;PlayStation
 2’s Japanese launch lineup. He then proceeded to mention how software 
on the PlayStation 2 was selling below expectations.</p>
<p>“If we release software for the console similar to what Sony has for 
PlayStation 2, that would be a&nbsp;failure. Currently, most games 
released for the PS2 are not selling well at all. I am confident that 
this is because game makers truly believe that they cannot make money on
 the PS2,” said Yamauchi.</p>
<p>Hiroshi Imanishi,&nbsp;Yamauchi’s right hand man,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/09/imanishi-talks-cube" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/09/imanishi-talks-cube">shrugged off the idea</a>&nbsp;that
 Sony was a major competitor. &nbsp;He claimed that Nintendo’s handheld 
division was a bigger threat to the GameCube than the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p><b>“</b>Well if I have to name one console which threatens Gamecube, 
it would be Game Boy Advance. Honestly, some may say that we are 
pretending to be strong, but we are not specifically thinking about 
so-called competition or rivals. People say, “Well, Sony should be the 
biggest competitor for the new Nintendo system.” Sony was originally a 
hardware-oriented company, and we are pretty much different. We are 
simply going ahead in our own direction, making fun and interesting 
games, and providing these games for our users. So we haven’t 
specifically been concerned with any competition.” said Imanishi.</p>
<p>Imanishi wasn’t the only one who didn’t feel threatened by the PlayStation 2. &nbsp;Shigeru Miyamoto said he <a title="http://www.angelfire.com/sd/gamecube/news/001.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.angelfire.com/sd/gamecube/news/001.html">didn’t care about the existence</a> of the PlayStation 2 because GameCube’s software was strong enough for people to buy two consoles.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t feel the slightest threat from the PlayStation 2, and 
very frankly speaking, I am not too concerned about the existence of the
 PS2 at all, because we have created the GameCube hardware and will 
create the software that will become the requisite for everyone even 
though they already have the PS2. That is why I’m not too concerned 
about the PlayStation 2,” said Miyamoto.</p>

<p>On October 22, 1999, Japanese gaming magazine&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/22/will-dolphin-sell-in-japan" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/22/will-dolphin-sell-in-japan">Famitsu Weekly conducted a survey</a>&nbsp;in
 which a number of respected game companies and retailers were asked the
 following question: How well do you think Dolphin will sell? 
Around&nbsp;45% of Japanese gamers surveyed said they have a positive 
outlook for Nintendo’s Dolphin while another 33.9% were still unsure one
 way or the other. Considering that no information had been released on 
the system (at this point in time), the results were better than 
expected.</p>
<p>The results:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will sell very well. — 3.2%</li>
<li>It well sell pretty good. — 41.9%</li>
<li>It won’t sell very well. — 17.8%</li>
<li>It won’t sell at all. — 1.6%</li>
<li>Not sure yet. — 33.9%</li>

Ranking at number two, Sega’s Dreamcast pulled 22.4%,&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo’s Dolphin system pulled 17.2% of the vote,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Microsoft’s X-Box came in last place with only 11.9% of the votes.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/10/dolphin-wanted-sort-of" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/10/dolphin-wanted-sort-of">June 2000 reader survey</a>&nbsp;conducted
 by gaming magazine Famitsu Weekly, Japanese gamers once again 
demonstrated their unanimous support for PlayStation 2 and significant 
disinterest in Nintendo’s next-generation console.</p>
<p>When asked if they would buy Nintendo’s Dolphin:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than a quarter (over 25%) of those surveyed answered that they will wait and see how the system does before deciding.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, a massive 34.3% of Japanese gamers polled said they don’t know if they will buy Dolphin or not.</li>
<li>Only 5.1% of those surveyed said they will buy Dolphin the first day it is released in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t too surprising since the Nintendo’s 64 popularity was at 
an all time low in Japan and most Japanese gamers had lost interest in 
Nintendo altogether.</p>

 some information on it”. Another developer said, “Nintendo is making 
the same old mistakes, it’s not giving us any incentive to bother with 
Dolphin”.</p>
<p>At the same event,&nbsp;Bill Gates called for mass developer support 
to drive the Xbox, and&nbsp;Microsoft was aggressively pursuing third 
party developers by delivering development kits to as many studios as 
possible.&nbsp;Technical director Jim Merrick <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/11/dolphin-x-ed-out" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/11/dolphin-x-ed-out">admitted to IGN</a> that it&nbsp;<strong>did not yet have a formal development program in place.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;He
 suggested that potential Dolphin developers could prepare for 
Nintendo’s future system by creating prototypes of their games on the 
highest performance PC that can be configured</p>
<p>By June 2000,&nbsp;no US companies had <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/4775" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/4775">working GameCube development kits</a>
 yet and were still in prototyping stages. Miyamoto explained, “There 
are several different stages of the development tools and until the 
final one is ready we just cannot mass produce them. Even at NCL we’re 
still dealing with simulation and emulation, but very soon we’re going 
to have the final development kit ready. In the interim, we’re working 
with incomplete setups. But soon the final kits will go out.”</p>
<p>On October 20, 2000, Technical Director Jim Merrick would&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1">give another update</a>&nbsp;on the GameCube development kits.</p>
<p>Merrick said, “Development kits are constantly evolving. It was only 
three weeks ago that we did a major revision on the N64 development 
kits. We’ll continue to evolve these things throughout their life — it’s
 part of their design. But do I think that the Gamecube development kits
 now are what they’ll be when the system launches? No. The development 
kits are pretty functional right now though. Is absolutely every feature
 implemented to the degree that we’d like it to be? No. But you can 
definitely make a game. We didn’t show any playable Gamecube games here,
 but I have played Gamecube games.”</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/09/imanishi-talks-cube" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/09/imanishi-talks-cube">December 2000 issue of Next Gen Magazine</a>,
 approximately 7 months after GDC, Hiroshi Imanishi said they are not 
approaching third parties to make games for GameCube. Instead, they 
expect third parties to come to them once the GameCube starts growing 
their install base.</p>
<p>“Nintendo’s position is that we are going to sell our hardware with 
our own software titles, and if consumers buy a number of Gamecubes, 
then licensees would become interested in making games for Nintendo 
Gamecube. That’s the general idea in Nintendo’s business.&nbsp;<strong>So we are not actually approaching them [third parties] and asking them to make software for Nintendo.</strong>&nbsp;Already there are a number of requests [from publishers] who would like to make the software for Gamecube, so&nbsp;<strong>probably in September we will start explaining the technology and delivering the development kits to them.</strong>&nbsp;Once
 again, it’s their decision. If they would like to make Gamecube 
software, that’s fine, but we will never demand them to make games for 
Gamecube,” said Imanishi.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1">Nintendo’s Perrin Kaplan</a>&nbsp;was
 asked if the company runs the risk of underselling the GameCube to game
 developers by keeping it so secretive. &nbsp;Many developers working on
 games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox were stumped when IGN asked them about
 GameCube development. &nbsp; Kaplain explained that Nintendo is less 
focused on trying to get tons of third party support and more focused on
 quality third party titles.</p>
<p>Kaplan responds, “I will say, and Microsoft will tell you this themselves,&nbsp;<strong>we’re a little more like a pyramid and I think Sony and Microsoft are inverted</strong>. They want to have the masses and third-parties producing stuff and few games come out of their own house,&nbsp;<strong>versus Nintendo which is fewer and greater</strong>,
 and then spreads from there. I mean, we do have a lot of folks that are
 working on games, and Jim and his group continue to bring more and more
 folks on — and now it’s going to escalate even further. But it’s a 
wholly different approach.&nbsp;<strong>We’re in the hit business and I think Sony is in the business of just having a lot of software to pick from.”</strong></p>
<p>On August 2001, Peter Main&nbsp;<a title="http://thegia.psy-q.ch/sites/www.thegia.com/news/0108/n23r.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://thegia.psy-q.ch/sites/www.thegia.com/news/0108/n23r.html">echoed Kaplan’s comments</a>, “<strong>Our focus is not on maximizing the number of developers on this system</strong>,
 it’s in optimizing the quality of those developers. We’re absolutely 
convinced we’ve got top-quality developers around the world working on 
this project.”</p>
<p>Nintendo’s Satoru Iwata emphasized a long belief by Hiroshi Yamauchi that Nintendo&nbsp;<a title="http://spong.com/article/2812/Satoru-Iwata-on-all-things-GameCube" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/2812/Satoru-Iwata-on-all-things-GameCube">does not believe in overwhelming third party support</a>.</p>
<p>“The GameCube has been well received by the development community, but&nbsp;<strong>we don’t believe in overwhelming third party support</strong>. However, we’re certainly talking with more developers about the possibility of working together. Frequently,&nbsp;<strong>developers use our platforms solely for their own self-interests, so it’s hard to form management relationships.</strong>&nbsp;
 Rather than business to business relationships, we’ve chosen more 
personal collaborations such as creator to creator. &nbsp;Capcom’s 
decision to release Biohazard on the GameCube is a direct result of 
that,” said Iwata.</p>

 Nintendo was charging a much higher licensing fee for GameCube ($11) 
while Microsoft and Sony charged ($7 – $9). This fell in line with a 
report <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5184" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5184">from&nbsp;IGN</a>&nbsp;that
 Microsoft was charging $8 (and possibly lower) licensing fee standard. 
One major publisher admitted to IGN that Microsoft had been very 
accommodating when it comes to fees.</p>
<p>When <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/03/microsoft-pays-for-gcn-software" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/03/microsoft-pays-for-gcn-software">Next Gen Magazine asked</a>
 Peter Main, Nintendo’s top Marketing executive, how they deal with 
Microsoft and Sony wooing the same companies, Main shrugged it off.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"><b>“</b>Third-party 
publishers know our price list, and it’s very similar to anything that’s
 out there. We know that’s consistent. What may be in question is 
marketing money. On the one hand, there was someone [Microsoft] who had 
no stake in the business and at any cost had to get in. They went to a 
variety of developers and agreed to pay, in essence, 100% of development
 costs with no strings attached, which had a lot of developers [coming] 
here and saying they have free goods that they can port to our system,” 
said Main.</span></p>
<p>Next Gen told Peter Main that it sounded like a good deal for Nintendo. &nbsp;Main replied, &nbsp;“<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">And [Microsoft] paid for the whole deal… We’ve been in the business for a few years,&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">and we didn’t do any deals like that</strong><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">.
 For better or worse, a $10 royalty plus the cost of their goods is 
about the same deal that all three companies are running on.”</span></p>
<p>On top of GameCube’s higher licensing fees, the shortages and delays 
of GameCube development kits would also push away developers from making
 games for the GameCube.</p>
<p>Technical director <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/20/the-big-gamecube-interview-part-1">Jim Merrick said</a>, “<strong>We are now and will be in a shortage condition for development kits for a long time to come.</strong>&nbsp;But
 going to low-cost disc-based media is breaking down some of the 
economic barriers that publishers felt toward the cartridge-based 
business. So we have a lot of interest.&nbsp;<strong>And we’re not going to be able to satisfy the demand for development kits.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, probably<strong>&nbsp;six months after the Gamecube launches we’ll still be in a shortage of development kits.&nbsp;</strong>We just can’t produce them fast enough.”</p>
<p>In 2001, many developers still hadn’t received their development 
kits, and this caused rumors to spread around the industry that GameCube
 might not launch that year. &nbsp;Nintendo’s George Harrison <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/21/nintendo-discourages-xbox-promotions-focuses-on-now" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/21/nintendo-discourages-xbox-promotions-focuses-on-now">put those rumors</a> to rest.</p>
<p><b>“</b>GameCube is&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;going to ship this 
year. I think there has been speculation because some of the 
third-parties have only received their development kits more recently 
and they’re saying, “Gee, if I can’t get a game ready, how could they 
possibly launch GameCube?” But the truth is that&nbsp;<strong>we prioritize the shipment of development kits.”&nbsp;</strong>said Harrison.<strong>&nbsp; “</strong>We
 certainly first provided them to our internal development groups, next 
to our second-party partners where we have investments like Rare and 
others. And then finally to what we really consider to be the cream of 
the third-party developers like Electronic Arts and a few others. So a 
third-party that has just received development hardware and says, “I 
can’t make a game by the end of 2001 so they won’t launch GameCube” is 
not keeping focused on what’s really important for us, which is that we 
have to have the best possible, exclusive software for the launch this 
October.”</p>
<p>The first twelve months of GameCube’s third party support was hurt by
 high licensing fees, shortages/delays of development kits, and Nintendo
 being very selective on who they worked with. After the Nintendo 64, 
this was not a good way to start the first year of third party support 
for Nintendo’s new console.</p>

<p>Since the GameCube days, Nintendo’s executives shared the opinion 
that multiplatform third party titles do not really benefit Nintendo’s 
business. Why? Because Nintendo’s business is about creating an 
experience that competitors can’t duplicate, and all three executives 
believed third party multiplatform titles on GameCube should offer 
something unique from the Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions. From 
Nintendo’s perspective, straight ports of multiplatform titles was a 
contradiction to the “Nintendo Difference” message that Nintendo was 
promoting at the time.</p>
<p>On February 7th, 2001, former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi&nbsp;<a title="http://spong.com/article/1041/Nintendo-boss-slams-GameCube-with-pessimism" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/1041/Nintendo-boss-slams-GameCube-with-pessimism">strongly criticized</a>&nbsp;the industry for creating one game and then porting it to all three consoles.</p>
<p>“Now<strong>&nbsp;software companies are going multi-platform, running one game on lots of consoles</strong>, just to sell that little bit more. Even Sega. I can understand why the industry’s flowing this way, but,&nbsp;<strong>speaking for Nintendo,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I can hardly welcome it</strong>,”
 said Yamauchi. &nbsp;“When a user chooses a game, he always searches 
for something new and fun in a way he’s never seen before. If games on 
Nintendo machines are do-able on other companies’ consoles, then we’ll 
lose those users’ support. If we can’t succeed in separating ourselves, 
then we won’t win this battle. And that’s the reason why I’m<strong>&nbsp;not overjoyed about multi-platform tactics.</strong>”</p>
<p>On May 16, 2001, the week of GameCube’s big debut at E3,&nbsp;Satoru Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-GameCube-to-out-entertain-rivals/2100-1040_3-257739.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-GameCube-to-out-entertain-rivals/2100-1040_3-257739.html">criticized third party publishers</a>&nbsp;for porting AAA blockbuster titles to multiple consoles.</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata said, “If that (keeps happening), the console business 
becomes a commodity business. There is no reason to choose one console 
over another, except price,” he said. “Then it doesn’t matter which 
machine you choose–they all play the same games.”</p>
<p>Just like Satoru Iwata and Hiroshi Yamauchi, Shigeru Miyamoto&nbsp;<a title="http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200302/005.asp" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200302/005.asp">was also not a fan</a>&nbsp;of third party developers creating a game and porting it to multiple consoles.</p>
<p><b>“</b>If you are just simply comparing the 3 hardware consoles in 
terms of functionality, you can make similar games and&nbsp;many people 
are now trying to introduce multiplatform games.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It may be good for game users<strong>&nbsp;but
 when it comes to some kind of unique interactions with the 
hardware&nbsp;I don’t think multiplatform games are contributing a lot.</strong>&nbsp;Whilst
 I think it is good to have many different titles for the platforms, I 
think that only Nintendo can provide certain experiences,” said 
Miaymoto.</p>
<p>Most Japanese publishers (during the early 2000’s) <a title="http://www.1up.com/features/xbox-sucks-japan" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.1up.com/features/xbox-sucks-japan">concentrated all of their development</a> on the best selling platform, but rising development costs were interfering with that strategy.</p>
<p>Yoshihiro Maruyama, general manager of Xbox’s Japanese division, <a title="http://www.1up.com/features/xbox-sucks-japan" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.1up.com/features/xbox-sucks-japan">told 1Up.com</a>&nbsp;in 2002,&nbsp;“The business model is different. <strong>You see companies in the U.S. using a multiplatform strateg</strong>y, developing games for several consoles at once, with Electronic Arts leading the way. However, <strong>Japan concentrates all its development on the top platform alone</strong>,
 so it’s easy to run into dead ends. Of course, I’m not saying we should
 all be like EA. If Japanese games lose their workmanship, their 
quality… Before the PlayStation, there were lots of games made with this
 ‘Hey, this is neat, let’s try this’ attitude that sold way beyond 
expectations. Now it’s more, like, ‘How many copies will this sell? If 
it won’t sell, we can’t do it’, and it’s getting harder to make new 
games.”</p>

<p>Seven months before GameCube’s Japanese launch, Hiroshi Yamauchi <a title="http://spong.com/article/1041/Nintendo-boss-slams-GameCube-with-pessimism" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/1041/Nintendo-boss-slams-GameCube-with-pessimism">criticized the industry</a>
 for focusing so heavily on pretty graphics and power.&nbsp;“Software 
companies have run out of new ideas, so now all they strive for is more 
graphics and more force,” said Hiroshi Yamauchi.</p>
<p>On May 16th, 2001, Satoru Iwata, director of Nintendo’s strategic 
planning, explained to reporters how graphics are now reaching 
diminishing returns. &nbsp;“There is not much more developers can do to 
impress players only with pictures. The hardest thing is to entertain,” 
said Iwata at a <a title="http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-GameCube-to-out-entertain-rivals/2100-1040_3-257739.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-GameCube-to-out-entertain-rivals/2100-1040_3-257739.html">press conference before the opening</a>
 of the Electronic Entertainment Expo. &nbsp;Two months after the 
GameCube’s successful North American launch, Hiroshi Yamauchi remained 
firm with his position that the industry should focus less on realistic 
graphics and <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881">more on ways to expand the market</a>.</p>
<p>“Every game developer is shooting for nothing but realism and 
flashiness, so we’re seeing an overflow of games that look exactly the 
same,” said Yamauchi. “What does realism and flashiness have to do with 
fun? If more games with new types of gameplay and fun come on the 
market, the market will expand, companies will have more support, and 
there’d be a business to work with.”</p>
<p>Yamauchi also highly criticized large-scale AAA games and said 
companies who make these kinds of games will eventually go 
bankrupt.&nbsp;“Large-scale games are done for. If they continue to be 
made, then companies around the world will go under,” said Yamauchi.</p>
<p>When asked why Nintendo chose smaller disks for GameCube instead of standard DVDs, Shigeru Miyamoto<a title="http://senseinaga.tripod.com/cube/news/7.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://senseinaga.tripod.com/cube/news/7.html"> explained that smaller disks sends a message</a> to developers that they don’t need to make long games with realistic graphics.</p>
<div>
<p>“I’m not sure if it’s the whole world demanding realistic graphics or
 just a limited number of games players, but some developers are in the 
mindset that they feel threatened by the world into making realistic 
looking games right now,” said Miyamoto. “Therefore, they just cannot 
afford the time to make unique software because they feel the pressure 
to make realistic games and are obsessed with graphics.”</p>
<p>He continues,”In the end, they cannot recoup their investment in the 
game.&nbsp;So in a way, the smaller disc is a message from Nintendo that
 you don’t need to fill out the capacity of a normal sized DVD 
disc.&nbsp;If we want to make larger software, then we just make the 
game on two or three discs.”</p>
</div>
<p>Speaking <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/04/interview-shigeru-miyamoto-and-satoru-iwata?page=4" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/04/interview-shigeru-miyamoto-and-satoru-iwata?page=4">with IGN</a>
 in 2002, Miyamoto further elaborated that games are becoming more 
expensive to produce, and it’s difficult to provide games at regular 
intervals when consumers expect longer games with richer graphics. 
&nbsp;To combat the rising costs of software development, Miyamoto says 
there is a greater tendency to create more compact games that focus on 
new ideas.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.notenoughshaders.com/?attachment_id=10971" rel="attachment wp-att-10971"><img src="A%20Dolphin%E2%80%99s%20Tale%20%20The%20Story%20of%20GameCube%20%E2%80%93%20Dromble_files/september-11th.jpeg" alt="september 11th banner" height="156" width="593"></a></p>
<p>Three days before the GameCube would launch in Japan, the United 
States would face the largest terrorist attack in American history. Even
 the Japanese, who normally aren’t concerned with American politics, 
found themselves glued to the television. &nbsp;Due to the September 
11th terrorist attacks, Nintendo’s share price had fallen 12% and <a title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1543302.stm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1543302.stm">reached its lowest point</a> of the year.</p>
<p>“The attacks prompted the sell-off since investors are worried the 
incidents will chill consumers’ Christmas shopping appetite for games,” 
said Nobumasa Morimoto, senior analyst at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities 
Co.</p>
<p>At the time, it was unknown what impact the September 11th terrorist 
attacks would have on the November U.S. launches of the Xbox and the 
GameCube. Keep in mind that the United States was also facing a weakened
 economy around this time.&nbsp;Would U.S. shoppers still be in the mood
 to buy game consoles two months after the biggest terrorist attack on 
American soil? &nbsp;Wes Nihei, a former&nbsp;<i>GamePro</i>&nbsp;magazine writer told <em>USA Today</em>,
 “when you factor in the economic atmosphere and the aftermath of the 
tragedy, you have to wonder how many people beyond the leading-edge, 
hard-core gaming community are going to be willing and able to spend 
several hundred dollars on video games.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the U.S. attack will affect us,” Nintendo spokesman 
Yasuhiro Minagawa said. &nbsp;Fairfield Research said there was <a title="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/games/2001/09/20/gamecube.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/games/2001/09/20/gamecube.htm">already a slight decline</a>
 in consumer interest to buy Xbox or GameCube before the terrorist 
attacks.&nbsp;Schelley Olhava, an analyst with IDC, said “From 
everything that I’m hearing, hardware and software game sales are still 
holding out strong and not being battered by the economy or terrorist 
attacks.”</p>
<p>Nintendo decided to postpone a <a title="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/games/2001/10/9/game-consoles.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/games/2001/10/9/game-consoles.htm">Hollywood GameCube launch event</a>
 that was originally planned for September 25th. &nbsp;Nintendo’s Perrin
 Kaplan said, “People just weren’t ready to smile. People are just now 
getting ready to at least take a little bit of a break from all the 
soul-searching.”</p>
<p>When the GameCube finally released in the U.S., Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881">believed that the impact</a> of the terrorist attacks may have helped the game industry.</p>
<p>“We released the system to the world’s largest market in November and
 the initial store shipment of 1.3 million systems is mostly sold out. 
About 4.5 million video game systems were sold overall; all three 
consoles were at nearly equal footing. I think the impact of the 
terrorist attacks helped all home entertainment products sell better.” 
said Hiroshi Yamauchi.</p>

<h1><strong>Launch Marketing Campaign</strong></h1>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIgpuGw168k">2001 Advert</a>
<p>In early 2001, Nintendo’s marketing chief Peter Main <a title="http://www.geek.com/games/nintendo-jealous-of-microsoft-545715/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.geek.com/games/nintendo-jealous-of-microsoft-545715/">sent out a letter</a> to ten major retail stores asking <strong>why Xbox was being promoted so early</strong>.
 &nbsp;The letter told retailers that manufacturers, publishers, and 
retailers rarely promote new products beyond the maximum 4-8 weeks 
before launch. &nbsp;Main blamed 2000’s 5-6% decline in sales on 
retailers promoting the PlayStation 2 instead of promoting current 
products already on store shelves. &nbsp;A <a title="http://www.geek.com/games/nintendo-jealous-of-microsoft-545715/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.geek.com/games/nintendo-jealous-of-microsoft-545715/">Microsoft spokesperson laughed off</a>
 Nintendo’s letter to retailers and said, “We’re flattered that Nintendo
 is taking the Xbox seriously, but it’s a bit odd to see them trying to 
take control of the information that gamers are getting at retailers.”</p>
<p>Nintendo launched a $75 million launch campaign for the Nintendo 
GameCube to highlight first and second party exclusive titles. 
&nbsp;During that 2001 holiday season, GameCube commercials were shown 
during “Harry Potter and the Sorceror’s Stone” and “Lord of the Rings: 
The Fellowship of the Ring”. &nbsp;In print media, eight GameCube print 
ads appeared in magazines such as “Maxim”, “Stuff”, and “Sports 
Illustrated for Kids”. &nbsp;Nintendo promised that more than 85 
full-page print ads will appear in over 50 
publications.&nbsp;Out-of-home GameCube advertising included large 
Nintendo GameCube banners in malls across the United States. 
&nbsp;Advertisements were placed during Channel One Broadcasting inside 
of high schools throughout the country.</p>
<p>For the launch campaign, Nintendo partnered with Dr. Pepper to 
promote an instant-win game with GameCube prizes and Nintendo characters
 appearing on 20-oz, 2-liter, and 12-can packages.</p>
<p>Before launch, Nintendo threw a celebrity-studded Hollywood party for
 Nintendo GameCube. &nbsp;Celebrities at the launch event included Ryan 
Reynolds, Paris Hilton, Tara Reid, Christina Aguleira, Michelle 
Rodriguez, and Lil Kim. &nbsp;There were also Nintendo “Cube Club” 
events in 15 different U.S. cities featuring live music and alcoholic 
drinks where people could play the system before launch.</p>

<p>The GameCube’s <strong>$75 million</strong> launch campaign <a title="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-kicks-off-xbox-television-campaign/1100-2822511/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-kicks-off-xbox-television-campaign/1100-2822511/">looked like chump change</a> in comparison to Xbox’s <strong>$500 million</strong>
 launch advertising campaign. &nbsp;Microsoft would make an attempt to 
overshadow Nintendo’s marketing campaign at all cost.&nbsp;Xbox’s<a title=" http://www.twice.com/news/shortages-seen-gamecube-xbox-make-debut-0" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.twice.com/news/shortages-seen-gamecube-xbox-make-debut-0"> launch advertising included</a> television ads aired on networks/shows such as Fox, Comedy Central, WWF Raw/Smackdown, ESPN, and MTV. Print ads for Xbox <a title=" http://www.twice.com/news/shortages-seen-gamecube-xbox-make-debut-0" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.twice.com/news/shortages-seen-gamecube-xbox-make-debut-0">were distributed in</a>
 magazines such as Maxim, Rolling Stone, FHM, GamePro, Game Informer, 
and Electronic Gaming Monthly. Microsoft also launched&nbsp;national 
promotions with companies such as Taco Bell, SoBe and Vans.</p>
<p>Peter Main, Nintendo’s Marketing Chief, &nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/12/nintendo-talks-xbox" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/12/nintendo-talks-xbox">seemed surprised</a> that any company would launch a product with a $500 marketing campaign.</p>
<p>“Is $500 million a lot to launch that? $500 million even in my 
sometimes-big numbers — you’d need one of those spreaders they use on a 
farm in order to really spread that kind of money around the world. It’s
 a huge number. They’re going to come and they’re going to make a big 
noise, and the jury is still out,” said Main.</p>
<p>Three months before the launches of GameCube/Xbox, <strong>IDC</strong>
 conducted a survey where they found that 32.9% of people intend to 
purchase a new console. &nbsp;An overwhelming majority, 62.9% say they 
plan to purchase a PlayStation 2. &nbsp;Only 6.3% of respondents said 
they plan to buy a GameCube and tiny 4.5% said they plan to buy an Xbox.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs&nbsp;<a title="http://www.psx2central.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-16074.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.psx2central.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-16074.html">conducted a survey</a>&nbsp;among 49 major retail chain stores in large cities to see how GameCube and Xbox were selling&nbsp;<strong>one week after</strong>&nbsp;their
 U.S. launches. &nbsp;73 percent of U.S. retailers said they had already
 sound out of Microsoft’s Xbox while 48 percent were sold out of 
Nintendo’s GameCube. &nbsp;But Goldman Sachs said Nintendo shipped 
700,000 units of GameCube to retailers while Microsoft had only shipped 
300,000 units of Xbox.</p>

<p>In 2003, The Ziff Davis Media Game Group <a title="http://www.chud.com/community/t/47444/xbox-to-overtake-gamecube-in-the-us" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.chud.com/community/t/47444/xbox-to-overtake-gamecube-in-the-us">conducted a survey</a>
 of 2000 gamers, and asked them which game consoles are they currently 
looking forward to. &nbsp;15 percent of respondents said they wanted to 
buy a Xbox while only 9 percent wanted a GameCube. The report also found
 that 50 percent of Xbox owners and 41 percent of PS2 owners had a 
broadband internet. &nbsp;Only 31 percent of GameCube owners said they 
had a broadband connection. During that same year, the <a title="http://www.suntimes.com/output/lazare/cst-fin-lew01.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.suntimes.com/output/lazare/cst-fin-lew01.html">Chicago Sun-Times reported</a>
 a new GameCube advertising campaign for&nbsp;both TV and print with the
 tagline”Who Are You?”. &nbsp;The ad campaign’s budget would cost over 
$100 million to produce.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems that plagued the GameCube was the “kiddy 
image” which pushed third party publishers away from releasing adult 
content on the console. &nbsp;For example, at the time there was a 
significant amount of attention surrounding “Metal Gear Solid 2” for the
 PlayStation 2. &nbsp;In <a title="http://www.xboxaddict.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1341.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.xboxaddict.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1341.html">Electronic Gaming Monthly&nbsp;(issue 147)</a>, Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was asked about the possibility of MGS2 coming to the Nintendo GameCube.&nbsp;Kojima <a title="http://www.xboxaddict.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1341.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.xboxaddict.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1341.html">responded</a>
 to EGM,&nbsp;“When I pick hardware to do a game, I don’t look at the 
specs of the machine. I don’t really care about that stuff. I don’t care
 about how good the system is, because all consoles right now are at 
about the same level of power. I look at the audience that it has. 
Releasing a&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>&nbsp;game on a Nintendo console 
would be ridiculous. I don’t know about GameCube, but [their] machines 
[until now] have been for younger kids.”</p>
<p>Eventually, the GameCube would receive “Metal Gear Solid: Twin 
Snakes,” but the project was not a priority for Kojima’s team, and it 
would be left in the hands of Silicon Knights to develop.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Silent Hill 2’s producer Akihiro Imamura was <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/29/gamecube-stripped-of-hill-sequel" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/29/gamecube-stripped-of-hill-sequel">asked by IGN</a> if a version of the franchise would come to Nintendo’s GameCube. &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Imamura </span><a style="line-height:1.5em;" title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/29/gamecube-stripped-of-hill-sequel" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/29/gamecube-stripped-of-hill-sequel">told IGN</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;">
 that a Silent Hill game would be too adult-like&nbsp;for the console. 
“Not likely,” he said. “The machine will probably be good, but the 
demographic will be largely younger gamers initially. That doesn’t 
really fit in with our market for the Silent Hill series.”</span></p>
<p>Howard Lincoln, who had left his role as chairman at Nintendo of America, was asked by <a title="http://thegia.com/archive/features/f010525.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://thegia.com/archive/features/f010525.html">the Gaming Intelligence Agency</a>
 about the Silent Hill 2 producer’s comments.&nbsp;“I think anybody who 
sees GameCube as just for young kids is crazy.” said Lincoln. 
&nbsp;Toward the middle of the interview, Lincoln explains, “There has 
always been a perception, and this is beyond Nintendo, that video games 
as a whole were passé or just for kids and didn’t appeal to a wider 
group. I think that because Nintendo has been successful with a younger 
audience as well, it leaves that impression in the minds of many that 
Nintendo games somehow just appeal to the young.”</p>
<p>Even developers like FromSoftware decided <a title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,557120,00.html#ixzz2O9ppDp16" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,557120,00.html#ixzz2O9ppDp16">to pile on the criticism</a>&nbsp;of
 Nintendo skewering to younger demographics.&nbsp;By 2003, FromSoftware 
would makes 15 titles for the PlayStation 2 but only two for the 
GameCube.</p>
<p>“Our target is high school students and older, not Nintendo’s grade 
school demographics,”&nbsp;said Minako Gotoh, an executive at 
FromSoftware.</p>
<p>FromSoftware was not the only company that felt this way around the GameCube.&nbsp;According <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/01/koei-talks-ps2-gamecube-and-xbox" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/01/koei-talks-ps2-gamecube-and-xbox">to IGN</a>,&nbsp;“Regarding the Nintendo GameCube,&nbsp;<strong>[Koei] believes Nintendo is targeting a low age group</strong>&nbsp;with the system and thus plans on developing games which concentrate on this group.”</p>
<p>Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto attempted to persuade third party 
developers to create unique content for the GameCube. However, most 
developers assumed that creating Nintendo content meant you have to 
skewer to younger audiences. &nbsp;Most companies at the time didn’t see
 much money in making games for that audience.</p>
<p>“I often talk to other developers and they think that we make 
GameCube software childish so that we can sell lots more games to 
children. Whenever we have talks with licensees or potential licensees, 
we make a point of asking them to make their game exclusive to Nintendo.
 They obviously mistook it for thinking that Nintendo wanted more 
childish looking games. So we had a lot of meetings with the licensees, 
like Sega, and explained that we really needed something unique from 
Sega. Then they said, “Actually we wanted to make more adult orientated 
games, rather than making them look childish,” so I said, “Actually, 
that’s what we wanted to say at the beginning.”&nbsp;said Miyamoto.</p>
<p>In a 2001 <a title="http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/eva/t-32566.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/eva/t-32566.html">interview with Edge Magazine</a>, Miyamoto clarified that Yamauchi was unhappy with the perception that Nintendo products were strictly for children.</p>
<p>“When it comes to the GameCube, a lot of the third parties are going 
to provide the variety of game genres once again, so in that sense I 
think we can be relieved. But it’s true that [NCL president] Mr. 
[Hiroshi] Yamauchi kind of hates for Nintendo to be called a toy for 
elementary school children—that’s one thing Mr. Yamauchi hates to hear,”
 said Miyamoto. &nbsp;“As a matter of fact, we’ve never made a Mario 
game for school children. It is true that these school children are 
playing a central role as core Nintendo users, but we will always make 
efforts to widen the audience. Having said that, this doesn’t mean we’re
 going to make 20-something-specific games. Rather, our aim is to make 
games which can appeal to small children as well as the parents, so that
 they can play together.”</p>
<p>In 2003, HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. analyst Ben Wedmore <a title="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-06-01/the-rough-play-in-video-games" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-06-01/the-rough-play-in-video-games">blamed GameCube’s childish image</a>
 for the poor sales. “Nintendo has to give the market more of what it 
wants. Today’s 11-year-olds aren’t going to buy Mario,” said Wedmore.</p>
<p>Another analyst, John Taylor of Oregon-based Arcadia Investment Corp, said Sony<a title="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/491/491439p2.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/491/491439p2.html"> did a much better job</a> attracting children under 12 to the PlayStation 2 than Nintendo did for the GameCube.</p>
<p>“Nintendo has appealed to two primary segments of the market,” said 
Taylor. “One is young households — households with children below 12 
years of age. And actually, Sony has even done better than Nintendo in 
that group. I hear the number floating around that Sony outsells 
Nintendo in households with sub-twelve-year-old players two-to-one, and 
that is Nintendo’s traditional core base.”</p>
<p>When <a title="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2002/2002-06-20-nintendo-gamecube.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2002/2002-06-20-nintendo-gamecube.htm">asked</a>
 why they are publishing “Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem”, an 
M-rated horror title, Nintendo’s Perrin Kaplan responded,&nbsp;“The kids
 who played Mario when they were 6 are now 28. They still want to play 
Mario, but they want some other stuff.” She continued to explained,”Our 
industry has matured. We’re like the movie industry. You see R-rated 
movies and M-rated games.”</p>
<p>Franchises like “The Legend of Zelda” also added fuel to the 
GameCube’s childish image which made people believe Nintendo was slowly 
abandoning older gamers. At Spaceworld 2001, Nintendo would reveal the 
new “Legend of Zelda” game for the GameCube, but it was a huge departure
 from the art direction of “Ocarina of Time” and “Majora’s Mask”. 
&nbsp;Fans around the world <a title="http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-legend_of_zelda_wind_waker_miyamoto.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-legend_of_zelda_wind_waker_miyamoto.htm">protested the game’s art direction</a>&nbsp;and some downright refused to buy a GameCube because of it.</p>
<p>“They all said, “Oh, so is Nintendo now&nbsp;<strong>taking Zelda and trying to aim it only at kids?</strong>”
 Really, the whole concept we had behind it was that we thought it was a
 very creative and new way to show off Link. All the sudden it had been 
interpreted as Nintendo’s new strategy, and that was a shock for us,” 
said Shigeru Miyamoto.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s former president Hiroshi Yamauchi <a title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/07/03/nintendos_yamauchi_speaks/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/07/03/nintendos_yamauchi_speaks/">believed that violent games</a> were responsible for hurting the sales of GameCube’s software.</p>
<p>“There have always been differences between players in Asia and those
 in North America and Europe,” he commented, “and I think those 
differences are becoming more clear.&nbsp;Sales of GameCube software 
fell short&nbsp;in North America and Europe&nbsp;last year, and I 
believe that’s&nbsp;<strong>due to the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>popularity of violent games&nbsp;</strong>on other consoles,” said Hiroshi Yamauchi.</p>
<p>Yamauchi continues, “The culture of Japan is very different and less 
accepting of such titles. &nbsp;Our target market is the entire world, 
so it’s very difficult to develop software that appeals to everyone – 
and that’s the lifeline of our business. That’s why it’s hard to achieve
 success in America and Europe for Japanese developers, even the most 
talented ones.”</p>

<p>David Gosen, a former managing director at Nintendo of Europe,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/522/522914p1.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/522/522914p1.html">called the Grand Theft Auto series</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;“a
 dead-end street.”&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he was glad GameCube didn’t have 
Grand Theft Auto because he didn’t want to have to defend his company 
from the issue of violent games.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto disagreed with Nintendo’s David Rosen. He liked the 
design of Grand Theft Auto and said it should be welcomed by the 
industry.</p>
<p><b>“</b>I have looked at Grand Theft Auto.&nbsp; The basic concept 
was very well done.&nbsp; Regardless of what the content of the game 
was, the level of freedom that you had in that one big city was a very 
good idea.&nbsp; Obviously it has gotten a lot of press because of the 
moral issues; but even aside from that, the game was done in such a way 
that gives it great gameplay,” said Miyamoto. &nbsp;He continues,”I 
think that is the reason that Grand Theft Auto is selling. &nbsp;Looking
 at this from the other side, I think we should welcome this game. 
Everybody is making all of this fuss about the incredible graphics and 
movies that they have in the games these days.&nbsp; For a game like 
Grand Theft Auto, which is not nearly as polished in terms of the 
graphical look, to do so well is positive for the game industry.”</p>
<p>During the GameCube era, Nintendo of Japan became confused by North 
America’s obsession with violence, epic cinematic stories, and photo 
realistic graphics.&nbsp; By 2004, games such as “Halo 2″ (sold 8 
million units) and “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas” (sold 17.33 million 
units) were stealing attention away from Nintendo’s first party titles. 
&nbsp;Kyle Mercury ,&nbsp;a brand specialist, technical director, and 
event specialist. for&nbsp;<strong>U.S. Concepts</strong> from 2001 through 2007, says Nintendo <a title="http://dropslash.com/journal/2011/10/pwp1/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://dropslash.com/journal/2011/10/pwp1/">became bothered</a> by western cultures’ obsession with violent games.</p>
<p>By 2005, discussion of high definition consoles were reaching an all 
time high with the launch of the Xbox 360, but Nintendo still had to 
focus their marketing efforts on current generation products.</p>
<p>“In meetings it was clear NoJ [Nintendo of Japan] could not 
understand why the brand had fallen so far here in North America or 
comprehend why the mature titles, and more powerful consoles, were so 
successful. Nintendo represented fun, in the purest sense of the word, 
they always have. When you play Nintendo games you laugh, you yell, you 
smile, and you jump around. You have FUN.&nbsp;Someone, sadly I forget 
who, would later quote in one of those meetings that “<em>Consumers don’t want fun anymore; they just want to kill people… in HD</em>.”
 It was actually kind of true, and with the cultural differences between
 Japan and the US, it was easy to understand the confusion. The problem,
 though, was that NoA wasn’t confused by the situation at all, they 
understood those cultural differences quite well, but even if they could
 defy the marching orders from [Nintendo of Japan], I’m not sure they 
even would have. Gaming was growing up. This is when things started to 
get real ugly for a while inside those hallowed walls.”</p>
<p>Nintendo never understood the criticism of catering to young children
 when their company was the only one aggressively catering to that 
market. &nbsp;Nintendo’s success was all about creating a formula that 
could work no matter age, gender, or geographic location.&nbsp;Satoru 
Iwata explains,”This criticism has always confused us for a couple of 
reasons. First, youngsters are the people with the most time to play the
 games, and often the most passionate. The fact is that Nintendo is the 
only manufacturer who seriously targets this market. Second, young 
people are important for another reason. They are the purest and truest 
indicator of game quality.”</p>
<p>In <a title="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/iwata-customers-do-not-want-online-games/1100-6102100/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/iwata-customers-do-not-want-online-games/1100-6102100/">an interview with <em>Spotlight</em></a>,
 Iwata singled out WarioWare Inc.: Mega MicroGame$ and Donkey Konga as 
examples of games that can appeal to people whether you are old or 
young. &nbsp;He believes creating those kinds of games is the correct 
strategy for Nintendo’s business.</p>
<p>“Game software should neither be exclusively targeted at children nor
 adults.&nbsp;Instead, we will develop software which anyone can 
instantly understand. When we market new software for adults, we should 
publicize it as software that everyone can enjoy… That will be more 
effective than undertaking a promotion specifically aimed at adults,” 
said Satoru Iwata.</p>
<p>“We always get Sony and others saying that Nintendo is for children, 
but it really isn’t. It’s about producing a formula that works 
everywhere around the world,” said Shigeru Miyamoto in an <a title="http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=1120" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=1120">interview with Japaninc</a>.</p>
<p>George Harrison, VP of Nintendo of America, <a title="http://www.nintengen.com/2006/04/new-game-informer-unlimited-interview.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintengen.com/2006/04/new-game-informer-unlimited-interview.html">admitted to Game Informer</a>
 that the “kiddy” perception of GameCube was real, but the demographics 
of GameCube’s audience told a different story. &nbsp;Harrison explained 
how Nintendo’s products have a large adult audience, but those same 
adults are too embarrassed to admit to their friends that they play 
Nintendo’s software.</p>
<p>“No, it is a real perception. But for us it’s somewhat mystifying 
because we look at the demographics of who has bought our hardware 
systems and it’s<strong> 40 percent over the age of 18 for GameCube</strong>
 and that type of thing. So it’s never been as complete as people make 
it seem or seem to believe,” said Harrison. “The number of people who 
are in college fraternities and in their 20s and 30s playing Mario Kart 
is kind of astounding. But if you go out to talk with your friends, 
you’re, “oh yeah. I don’t play Mario Kart, I play Need for Speed: 
Underground,” or something.”</p>

<p>When ArtX first began development on Dolphin’s hardware, they pitched the idea <a title="http://kidscreen.com/2013/11/12/the-plumbers-apprentice/#ixzz2pM1cs2fX" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://kidscreen.com/2013/11/12/the-plumbers-apprentice/#ixzz2pM1cs2fX">of doing a multi-media console</a>
 that would be capable of more than just playing games. &nbsp;Nintendo 
considered the idea as they tried figuring out what direction that 
Dolphin’s hardware needed to go. Unfortunately, Nintendo realized they 
didn’t have the resources like Sony and Microsoft to create a console 
with non-gaming functionality.</p>
<p>The founder of Art X, Timothy Van Hook, <a title="http://kidscreen.com/2013/11/12/the-plumbers-apprentice/#ixzz2pM1cs2fX" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://kidscreen.com/2013/11/12/the-plumbers-apprentice/#ixzz2pM1cs2fX">explains</a>,
 “We prepared our all-inclusive competing proposal, a universal 
“multi-media engine.” &nbsp;Sure, it would cost more, and early 
production units might have to be subsidized by game sales. 
&nbsp;Nintendo considered our vision. &nbsp;We waited. &nbsp;Finally, 
they explained that they would not be able to proceed in that direction.
 &nbsp;<strong>“We are a very small game company. &nbsp;We do not have the resources of these others.”</strong> &nbsp;Yep. &nbsp;A little humility goes a long way. &nbsp;Pick your battles, marshal your cash flow, do what you do best.”</p>
<p>Although the GameCube was powerful, the console’s design was heavily 
criticized for looking like a child’s Fischer Price toy. The lack of DVD
 player functionality, Nintendo’s disinterest in online gaming, and a 
cheaper price also helped encourage the console’s toy image. In a&nbsp;<a title="http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-2-PSOne/Oddworld-Disses-Dolphin-Poor-nintendo-fans-awaaaww/td-p/1059519" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-2-PSOne/Oddworld-Disses-Dolphin-Poor-nintendo-fans-awaaaww/td-p/1059519">2000 issue of Hyper Magazine</a>,
 &nbsp;Oddworld Inhabitants’ co-founder Lorne Lanning expressed 
disappointment in&nbsp;Nintendo’s philosophy&nbsp;of treating game 
consoles as toys. &nbsp;At the time, the developer had “Munch’s Oddysee”
 in the works for PlayStation 2, and they had no plans to develop for 
Nintendo’s forthcoming console at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Munch’s Oddysee
 would later become an exclusive launch title for the original Xbox.</p>
<p>“As for the Dolphin, it seems as though Nintendo has made it clear that they are a&nbsp;<strong>toy company</strong>&nbsp;only and have no interest in being a<strong>&nbsp;true media entertainment company</strong>,”&nbsp;said
 Lanning.&nbsp;“They want to keep making machines with limited potential
 so that they can keep control over game developers and publishers while
 enforcing those insanely high manufacturing costs.”&nbsp;Lanning then 
continued,&nbsp;“The Dolphin is not on our radar screens.”</p>
<p>Robert J. Bach, Microsoft’s Xbox chief&nbsp;<a title="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-06-01/the-rough-play-in-video-games" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-06-01/the-rough-play-in-video-games">told Businessweek</a>, “I don’t think Nintendo is here for the digital-entertainment revolution. They are a toy company.”</p>
<p>Gaming-only consoles like Dreamcast and GameCube were being slammed 
as niche products (or toys) while Sony and Microsoft products were 
hailed as the “future of entertainment”.</p>
<p>“The battle is over entertainment. Period. If you don’t have that 
vision, you are forever going to be a niche player,” declared Jack 
Tretton, executive vice president at Sony Computer Entertainment 
America.</p>
<p>Mark Rubenelli from THQ echoed the toy comments.</p>
<p>“Nintendo has very much said that Gamecube&nbsp;<strong>is going to the toy crowd</strong>, that it’s not going to be a convergence machine; it’s going to be a box that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>plays games exclusively,<strong>&nbsp;not a DVD-player or a multimedia super system</strong>. You know, it’s going to play games and it’s going to play games really well.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think that we feel like that<strong>&nbsp;caters to a little bit of a younger crowd.</strong>&nbsp;With that said, we obviously have a lot of products that work towards that audience.”</p>
<p>Publishers like Take-Two Interactive and THQ criticized Nintendo for 
creating a stand-alone game machine. Marketing research revealed that 
most people are looking for systems with extra features like DVD and 
online capabilities.</p>
<p>Jeff Lapin, CEO of <strong>Take-Two</strong>&nbsp;<a title="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/08/01/346319/index.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/08/01/346319/index.htm">explained to CNN</a>,&nbsp;“I
 think Nintendo is going to have to redefine its hardware if it wants to
 compete,”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;“The simple fact is that people are 
looking for extra features.”</p>
<p>When asked about the GameCube, Former&nbsp;<strong>THQ </strong>president&nbsp;Brian Farrell&nbsp;<a title="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/08/01/346319/index.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/08/01/346319/index.htm">told CNN</a>,”I’m not sure there’s room for a stand-alone game machine,”</p>
<p>Former Nintendo employee Jim Merrick told IGN, &nbsp;“The challenge 
is to produce something that differentiates itself. But we&nbsp;<strong>don’t want to be confused as a consumer electronics device.</strong>&nbsp;We’re
 not trying to be another component in your home stereo rack. &nbsp;It’s
 not the look that we’re going for — we want something that’s more 
approachable and more fun. ”</p>
<p>Nintendo’s Jim Merrick and Perrin Kaplan <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/13/interviewing-nintendos-jedi-council-2" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/13/interviewing-nintendos-jedi-council-2">defended the GameCube</a> from criticism that their company is only interested in making toys.</p>
<p>“I mean, what’s a toy? How do you define a toy? Is Aibo a toy?,” asks
 Merrick. &nbsp;“Aibo is a very sophisticated piece of technology, you 
know. Is it because of the technology that we don’t want to call it a 
toy? A toy is something a kid likes to spend time with. It’s an 
important part of a child’s development and playtime. Is there something
 wrong with being a toy? I have toys.”</p>
<p>Kaplan also adds,”You do have a lot of electronics and gadgets. But, I
 wouldn’t classify GameCube as a toy. We’re an entertainment company.”</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto remained firm on his stance that DVD players have no place in game machines. He <a title="http://spong.com/article/2926/Shigeru-Miyamoto-Interview-Part-2-The-most-complete-interview-anywhere-on-the-web" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/2926/Shigeru-Miyamoto-Interview-Part-2-The-most-complete-interview-anywhere-on-the-web">described the problems</a> associated with combining DVD players in game consoles such as accessing time for media and the costs of repairing it.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto <a title="http://spong.com/article/2926/Shigeru-Miyamoto-Interview-Part-2-The-most-complete-interview-anywhere-on-the-web" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/2926/Shigeru-Miyamoto-Interview-Part-2-The-most-complete-interview-anywhere-on-the-web">said</a>,”We
 have come up with the best hardware ever with the Nintendo GameCube 
system. I don’t know about Europe, but in Japan, DVD players are now 
very cheap. There is no need to combine the games machine with the DVD 
player as&nbsp;<strong>that can lead to other problems</strong>. These 
kind of hardware devices are destined to be broken and will need 
repairing: even if your games system is OK, if your DVD system playback 
is out of order&nbsp;<strong>you’ll have to get it repaired which can cost a lot of money.</strong>&nbsp;”&nbsp;He
 further explains,”Also, when it comes to the accessing time for the 
media, this is quite good in comparison: for example, in order to access
 a bigger disc, you need more power. Then there is the problem of the 
disc scratching when it is released on a DVD sliding tray. ”</p>
<p>At a <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/tgs-2003-iwata-keynote" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/tgs-2003-iwata-keynote">TGS 2003 keynote speech</a>, Satoru Iwata warned that the convergence of entertainment functions with gaming consoles could lead to problems. &nbsp;One <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/tgs-2003-iwata-keynote" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/tgs-2003-iwata-keynote">example he gave</a>
 was how games on cell phones were a bad idea because they use up 
battery power quickly which impacts your ability to make calls. He also <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/tgs-2003-iwata-keynote" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/tgs-2003-iwata-keynote">expressed his concern</a> over companies using non-gaming capabilies to sell gaming consoles.</p>
<p>“Although PS2 was a sales success because it had a DVD player 
function, it troubled me that we had moved to a hardware where the sole 
function wasn’t playing games,” said Satoru Iwata.</p>

<p>After selling <strong>20.64 million units</strong> of Nintendo 64 in 
North America, Nintendo of America had successfully maintained most of 
the SNES’s North American install base of <strong>23 million</strong>. 
Nintendo of America had successfully convinced most of the North 
American audience who loved SNES to buy a Nintendo 64 thanks to western 
exclusives like “Goldeneye 007”, “Turok 2: Seeds of Evil”, and “Star 
Wars: Shadows of the Empire”. Unfortunately, Nintendo of Japan (5.54 
million) and Nintendo of Europe (6.75 million) couldn’t find similar 
success which contributed to Nintendo 64’s low worldwide sales 
performance.</p>
<p>With 62% of Nintendo 64’s worldwide sales from North America, this 
convinced Nintendo of Japan to loosen the leash over Nintendo of 
America.</p>
<p>NOA Chairman Howard Lincoln <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/03/noa-on-dolphin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/03/noa-on-dolphin">explained</a>,&nbsp;“I’ve
 seen a natural transition over the years from the early 80s when our 
parent company [NCL] was essentially doing everything to today where 
Nintendo of America has a great deal of involvement with the development
 of Dolphin. A lot of the control, not only in Dolphin development 
systems, but actual development of the ArtX chip, relations with IBM and
 what-not are all being handled here at NOA. And certainly the 
relationship that we’ve developed with second-party developers, for 
example Rare, Retro, Left Field and others — those are all companies 
that we deal with. &nbsp;So we are much more involved with both the 
development of the hardware and software [for Dolphin] and I anticipate 
the same thing will be the case for Game Boy Advance.”</p>
<p>To continue building a strong presence in North America, NOA 
president Minoru Arakawa and Chairman Howard Lincoln made the decision 
to invest in more developers that skewered to western tastes.&nbsp;This 
would lead to the creation of Nintendo Software Technology, a first 
party developer in Redmond, Washington. &nbsp;NST was founded in 1998 by
 two men, Claude Comair and Scott Tsumura, who worked around the clock 
to get a next generation “Wave Race” ready for the Dolphin’s launch.</p>
<p>When Claude Comair <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/nst-talks-n64-dolphin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/nst-talks-n64-dolphin">was asked</a>
 about how NST was created, he replied,&nbsp;“It’s actually the 
brainchild of Mr. Arakawa.&nbsp;He [Arakawa] invited myself and Scott 
Tsumura [president, NST] to dinner at his place. He asked if we could be
 compatible together. Mr. Arakawa proposed the idea of this wonderful 
adventure and as you can imagine we accepted. We are here today.”</p>
<p>On May 2000, one year after creating NST, Nintendo of America invests
 in a Canadian developer called Silicon Knights. &nbsp;At the time, they
 were busy developing “Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem” for the 
Nintendo 64, but the project would be moved to the Dolphin 
[GameCube].&nbsp;Arakawa <a title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/93852/Silicon_Knights_Investment.php" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/93852/Silicon_Knights_Investment.php">told the press</a>.”Quality always has been the Nintendo mantra, so investing in Silicon Knights fits perfectly with our corporate goal.”</p>
<p>When asked about how Nintendo decides which developers are worthy of 
second party status, Nintendo of America’s marketing executive Peter 
Main replies,”Well, we don’t have a help wanted ad out. We continue to 
search the world for the right people and the right situations. Our 
announcement a week ago about Silicon Knights was exactly that kind of 
process. Proven capabilities, technically very competent people, and 
ready to do some great work on the fly with us. And we’ll continue to 
look to existing second-party people in helping them grow their own 
teams and leverage their own skills. Our financial support there can be 
very important in addition to new embryonic situations that we can 
grow.”</p>
<p>Peter Main <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/15/the-main-man-talks-dolphin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/15/the-main-man-talks-dolphin">explained</a>
 that the reason Arakawa and Lincoln recruit second party developers is 
because Nintendo of Japan understood the limitations of what type of 
games they can make. Since the NES days, publishers have become less 
loyal to one specific platform, and Nintendo saw second-parties as a 
logical extension to their Japanese developers.</p>
<p>“We continue, let me say, to have the utmost respect for the 
third-party world and its potential to be a very important part of our 
program going forward. However, in recent times a number of things have 
happened beyond that. Brand loyalty, by virtue of games being available 
on every platform, has somewhat reduced since the NES days when we did 
have platform exclusivity. We know that core to our business are the 
franchise characters that we own. We know the limitations of our own 
development skills,” said Peter Main.</p>
<p>Main <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/15/the-main-man-talks-dolphin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/15/the-main-man-talks-dolphin">continues</a>,”In
 that line, we set out to find partners who could further build the 
brand identity and personality with product that would appear 
exclusively on our platform. We’re not a cash poor company, so bringing 
financial resources to groups that show tremendous creativity and 
development potential makes good sense.The second-parties have become 
very logical extensions of what we do so well with our group in Japan 
and NST now in America. And given the rate of change with new platforms,
 and what essentially in engineering terms becomes fast-track projects, 
in order to make them happen in the least amount of time, you need to 
bring people into your tent long before you’re finished. That is better 
done with internal partners than external ones.&nbsp;That all said and 
done, <strong>we think it helps us, especially in our next go-around, come to market with more product, and more diverse product</strong>,
 created by people who didn’t have to wait for final tools to be made 
available, and instead could do it on the fly with us as we develop the 
components.</p>
<p>Retro Studios was founded in Austin, TX on October 1998 by former 
Acclaim Entertainment employee Jeff Spangenberg. &nbsp;He had convinced 
Howard Lincoln to fund the studio and position it to become the 
“Rareware of the United States”. Retro Studios had begun work on four 
projects for the GameCube: “Nintendo NFL Football”, “Thunder Rally” 
(also known as “Car Combat”), “Raven Blade” (aka “Rune Blade”), and a 
first person shooter vaguely titled “Action 
Adventure”.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nintendo of America counted on Retro Studios to 
create launch titles for the Dolphin that would cater to adult 
audiences. &nbsp;When Retro pitched the idea of Mario Football, this is 
why the idea was quickly shot down for a NFL licensed game instead.</p>
<p>This is when things started to go downhill at Retro Studios. 
&nbsp;Projects at Retro Studios were being understaffed and employees 
were being overworked.</p>
<p>Jeff Spangenberg&nbsp;was excessively absent, projects went without 
supervision, and Nintendo was always kept in the dark about the 
company’s progress. &nbsp;Higher up executives at Retro Studios <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=8" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=8">were accused</a> of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the company and fleeing the country. Other executives <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=8" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=8">were accused</a>
 of using Retro Studio’s computers to run porn websites.&nbsp;One source
 told IGN that Retro Studios had become an extremely paranoid company. 
They regularly kept track of employees with security cameras and 
micromanaged how long employees took lunches. &nbsp;“It honestly felt a 
little like living in a communist block country: you kind of didn’t know
 who to trust, who would rat on you, that sort of thing,” said one 
former Retro Studios employee. &nbsp;By 2001, photos had surfaced of 
Spangenberg in hot tubs with half-naked women on a website registered to
 a mailing address from Retro Studio.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s NFL football game, originally scheduled for GameCube’s 
launch, would eventually be cancelled along with other titles. &nbsp;The
 game had missed the market window for an NFL football title.</p>
<p>Jason Hughes, a former Retro Studios employee, explained,”The nice 
way to put it is we missed the market window for an NFL football title. 
The not-so-nice way is that the GameCube was originally planned to ship 
at the start of football season, but was pushed back to several months 
after the start of football season. A new flagship football launch title
 would have a hard time capturing the core NFL audience at that time of 
year on a new console.”</p>
<p>Although the game had reached close to completion, certain aspects of the game weren’t ready when they needed to be.</p>
<p>“Some aspects were well advanced, while others had barely begun. For 
instance, we had networking support, a full replay system, a fast 
stadium renderer, but almost no collision detection, on-field AI was 
under constant revision, and the animation system was not fully 
functional,” explained Hughes.</p>
<p>Retro’s “Thunder Rally”, the furthest Retro Studios project in development, was pitched to Nintendo of America as a <em>Twisted Metal Black&nbsp;</em><strong>Killer </strong>with elements of <em>Mario Kart</em> and <em>QuakeWorld</em>.
 &nbsp;Initially, the game would combine four player split-screen with 
online multiplayer, but since Nintendo didn’t believe online gaming was 
cost effective, these ideas never materialized.&nbsp;After Nintendo 
evaluated Retro’s projects, they&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=7" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=7">decided that Thunder Rally was too high risk</a>&nbsp;of an investment, and the game was quietly cancelled.</p>
<p>In April 2000, Shigeru Miyamoto visited Retro Studio to review the progress of Retro’s numerous projects. One source <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=5" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=5">told Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>
 that, “It was like the Emperor visiting the Death Star. He didn’t seem 
to like any of the games very much, especially the racing title, which 
was probably our best-looking.&nbsp;Nintendo would come down about three
 times a year and rip on most of the games, except [Retro NFL] Football,
 which was under the radar.”</p>
<p>“We could have literally blown [<em>Twisted Metal Black</em>] away on
 the level of interactivity the game could’ve had. Much more strategy in
 manipulation, avoiding, changing world objects to modify gameplay, and 
so on,” an employee at Retro Studios&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=7" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios?page=7">told IGN</a>. “We would have had many more weapons than&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal Black</em>, with multiple functions including counters, additive effects, complementary effects, etc.”</p>
<p>A trailer for Retro’s role-playing title, “Raven Blade” debuted at E3
 on May 2001 with much applause from gamers and the press. But behind 
the scenes, the studio had been struggling to create a decent combat 
system ever since development began in 1999. Nintendo gave Retro Studios
 a deadline to significantly improve Raven Blade by June 24, 2001 or the
 project would be terminated.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2001, Nintendo <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/19/raven-blade-killed-retro-lays-off-26" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/19/raven-blade-killed-retro-lays-off-26">officially announces</a>
 the cancellation of Raven Blade and layoffs of 26 staff members. 
&nbsp;The remaining members of the 35 member team would move over to the
 Metroid Prime project.</p>
<p>“Retro, along with Nintendo, has decided its most effective approach 
as a videogame developer is to focus on Metroid and give it the 
attention the franchise deserves,” said Nintendo. “To do that, they 
refined staffing and are laying off 26 people, mainly the team that 
worked on Raven Blade. Raven Blade is now cancelled.”</p>
<p>Nintendo decided that Retro Studios should focus all of their energy 
on Metroid Prime. Fans were already protesting the idea of a western 
studio handling Metroid, but the idea of turning Metroid into a first 
person action title caused an even greater uproar on the internet. 
&nbsp;It’s not surprising that Miyamoto suggested the idea of turning 
Metroid into a first person title. &nbsp;Originally, Miyamoto considered
 <a title="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2008/05/12/miyamoto-ocarina-of-time-could-have-been-an-fps/1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2008/05/12/miyamoto-ocarina-of-time-could-have-been-an-fps/1">creating Zelda 64 as a first person action game </a>after
 being inspired by other Nintendo 64 games like “Turok: Dinosaur 
Hunter”. &nbsp;After Zelda 64, Miyamoto was never ever able to fully let
 go of the idea of creating an action game with a first person 
perspective. &nbsp;Thankfully, both studios (Nintendo and Retro Studios)
 proved the criticism of Metroid’s new direction wrong, and “Metroid 
Prime” went on to become one of the most critically acclaimed games in 
Nintendo’s history.</p>
<p>Because Retro Studios was surrounded with controversy, Jeff 
Spangenberg knew that he wouldn’t be able to sell his company for very 
much money. For a&nbsp;bargain price of $1 million, Nintendo acquired 
Retro Studios from Spangenberg, and Retro Studios would now become a 
first party developer.</p>

<p>Hiroshi Yamauchi was looking forward to retiring, but he wanted to 
see the GameCube successfully launch before doing so. The retirement of 
Yamauchi would bring significant change to the corporate culture at 
Nintendo. Yamauchi <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6881">told the press</a>,
 “I’ve been thinking about it for more than two years now, but I think I
 want to retire before this summer. Nintendo isn’t going to work under 
one person anymore, though; it will be run under a group-leadership 
system.”</p>
<p>Before Hiroshi Yamauchi could retire, Nintendo of America was already
 going through a transformation of its own.&nbsp;John Taylor, managing 
director for Arcadia Investment Corp, <a title="http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=33" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=33">explained</a>,&nbsp;<span style="font-size:small;">“Japan
 is probably becoming a bit more influential in the day-to-day 
management decisions at Nintendo of America. It seems that might have 
been going on for a little while.”</span></p>
<p>It’s natural for executives and employees to eventually depart from a
 company, but the late 90’s through the early 2000’s would leave the 
biggest impact on the corporate culture of Nintendo of America.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Timeline for Nintendo of America Departures</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 1996,&nbsp;<strong>Tony Harmon</strong>&nbsp;retired from his

“Eternal Darkness”, “Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire”, “Diddy Kong 
Racing”, and “Super Punch-Out”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tony Harmon, former Nintendo executive, was the person who persuaded 
Ken Lobb to join Nintendo of America in 1994. Around 2000, Lobb 
was&nbsp;involved as a producer/supervisor on projects such as “Star 
Wars Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader” and “Metroid Prime”. &nbsp;Before 
GameCube launched, Ken Lobb&nbsp;<a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxAVIoExvo" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxAVIoExvo">says NOA employees were playing</a>&nbsp;16-player
 LAN multiplayer of Halo inside of Nintendo of America’s Treehouse. 
&nbsp;At the time, Lobb was interested in online gaming, but Nintendo 
did not have an aggressive approach to the online area.</p>
<p>With Minoru Arakawa and Howard Lincoln retiring, Ken Lobb lost 
interest in staying with Nintendo of America, and chased after new 
opportunities over at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Ken Lobb <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxAVIoExvo" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxAVIoExvo">said</a>,”I
 have infinite respect for Mr. Arakawa and Mr. Lincoln and it was 
awesome to see them get the lifetime achievement awards. Extremely well 
deserved. &nbsp;<strong>If Mr. Arakawa had not left Nintendo, I would probably still be there today.”&nbsp;</strong>He <a title="http://www.the-magicbox.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1436" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.the-magicbox.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1436">explains</a>,“When
 I was at Nintendo–especially when it was Howard [Lincoln], Peter [Main]
 and Mr. Arakawa–they were such great guys. I have infinite respect for 
them, they really understood the industry, maybe better than anyone else
 in the world.&nbsp;<strong>Having them leave changed what Nintendo was like, especially when Mr. Arakawa left.</strong>&nbsp;I didn’t even look for this job. It was offered to me by a friend.”</p>
<p>In a <a title="http://www.the-magicbox.com/forums/showpost.php?p=15802&amp;postcount=7" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.the-magicbox.com/forums/showpost.php?p=15802&amp;postcount=7">separate interview</a>,
 Lobb explained that he had already seen the games that Nintendo was 
bringing to GameCube before they were revealed to the public. Based on 
what he saw, he wasn’t very confident in the GameCube’s future.</p>
<p>“I was spending, from the launch of Xbox and GameCube, 35-40 percent 
of my time on PS2, 45 percent on the Xbox, and barely touching my 
GameCube. And knowing what the portfolio was going to be on the GameCube
 this year and going way out, I decided that I didn’t want to do this 
again. I did it on the N64 and it was hard. Having seen that that was 
going to be that–or was going to be worse, I said forget it. I’m tired 
of second-class third-party ports and I’m tired of first-party games 
spread way out,” said Lobb.</p>
<p>On May 31st, Satoru Iwata would replace Hiroshi Yamauchi as the new 
president of Nintendo Co., Ltd. &nbsp;Due to Iwata’s knowledge of 
Nintendo’s software and hardware, Mr. Yamauchi believed that Iwata was 
the right person for the job. &nbsp;While many executives are 
successful, Yamauchi didn’t trust bringing in anyone who had little 
understanding of Nintendo’s products. &nbsp;In a press conference, 
Hiroshi Yamauchi explained his decision for appointing Iwata as the new 
president of the company.</p>
<p>Yamauchi addressed the press,“The reason for Iwata-san’s selection comes down to <strong>his knowledge and understanding of Nintendo’s hardware and software</strong>.
 An executive, regardless of his vast successes, is fundamentally an 
executive, who doesn’t intimately understand our products.” Yamauchi 
continues, “Within our industry there are those who believe that they 
will succeed simply because of their successes in other ventures or 
their wealth, but that doesn’t guarantee success. Looking at their 
experiences since entering the gaming world, it’s apparent that our 
competitors have yielded far more failures than successes. It’s been 
said that Sony is the current winner in the gaming world. However, when 
considering their ‘victory’, you should remember that their success is 
only a very recent development. Though Sony is widely held to be the 
strongest in the market, their fortunes may change. Tomorrow, they could
 lose that strength, as reversals of fortune are part of this business. 
Taking into account the things I’ve encountered in my experiences as 
Nintendo president, I have come to the conclusion that it requires a 
special talent to manage a company in this industry. <strong>I selected Iwata-san based on that criteria.</strong>
 Over the long-term I don’t know whether Iwata-san will maintain 
Nintendo’s position or lead the company to even greater heights of 
success. <strong>At the very least, I believe him to be the best person for the job.</strong>”</p>
<p>For over five decades, Hiroshi Yamauchi had been running the company 
ever since it was passed on from his great grandfather Fusajiro 
Yamauchi. &nbsp;On May 31st, the company’s corporate structure would 
shift and regroup as Yamauchi relinquished his duties to a group of 
representatives.</p>
<p>With Satoru Iwata becoming the new president, the following executives <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/31/nintendo-shifts-leadership" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/31/nintendo-shifts-leadership">would join</a> his side:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tatsumi Kimishima :</strong>&nbsp;Director and president, Nintendo of America.</li>
<li><strong>Atsushi Asada</strong>&nbsp;: Chairman, formerly representative director, executive vice president.</li>
<li><strong>Yoshihiro Mori :</strong>&nbsp;Senior managing director, general manager, corporate analysis and administrative division.</li>
<li><strong>Shinji Hatano</strong>&nbsp;: Senior managing director and general manager, licensing division.</li>
<li><strong>Genyo Takeda</strong>&nbsp;: Senior managing director and general manager, integrated research and development division.</li>
<li><strong>Shigeru Miyamoto</strong>&nbsp;: Senior managing director and general manager, entertainment analysis and development division.</li>

<li><strong>Nobuo Nagai</strong>&nbsp;: Managing director and general manager, manufacturing division.</li>
<li><strong>Eiichi Suzuki</strong>&nbsp;: General manager, general affairs division.</li>
<li><strong>Hiroshi Imanishi:&nbsp;</strong>Would retire from his position in the corporate communication division and become a corporate advisor.</li>

<p>When Rareware employee, Mark Betteridge, was asked about how Nintendo
 has changed over the years, he said Nintendo was just changing with the
 times.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><b>“</b>Times change, and Nintendo 
as a company has changed, even when we were with them. We were with Mr. 
Minoru Arakawa and Howard Lincoln primarily, but we knew Satoru Iwata 
quite well, and Shigeru Miyamoto-san, obviously. They used to come and 
visit, and they were great people. The unusual thing, I suppose, at 
Nintendo is that the execs [that are in place] now were originally 
developers, which is quite unique. So it’s not so much that I miss the 
original people; I just miss the people and the personal contact. There 
were some happy times there,” said Betteridge.</span></p>

<p>Rare Ltd., also known as Rareware, was one of the first developers to
 receive development kits for Nintendo’s Dolphin. &nbsp;Rare Ltd’s 
Chairman and technical director Chris Stamper <a title="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/2181.wss" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/2181.wss">spoke on</a>
 IBM’s&nbsp;“Gekko” processor chip which would help power GameCube’s 
hardware.&nbsp;“Designing games is an ever-changing process, and this 
chip with its speed and seamless data flow, will allow us to make even 
more amazing games, ” explained Stamper. “Consumers will love the end 
result with the upcoming system.”</p>
<p>Asked how he felt about Rareware’s E3 2000 lineup, Shigeru Miyamoto 
said that Rare had been very influential on the industry, and they had 
encouraged Nintendo to experiment with more genres.</p>
<p><b>“</b>We are very thankful that Rare is creating such great games. 
Rare has done a lot for the gaming industry. All of Rare’s games are 3D,
 but they all have very different gameplay. They are encouraging us to 
create a different genre of games that departs from 3D adventure 
gaming,” said Miyamoto.</p>
<p>During that same E3 2000 event, Miyamoto was asked in a&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/06/interview-miyamoto-and-aonuma" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/06/interview-miyamoto-and-aonuma">seperate interview</a>&nbsp;about
 his thoughts on Rare’s Dinosaur Planet. &nbsp;“It looks really nice, 
doesn’t it? I wish they would use Star Fox characters so that they could
 use the title Star Fox Adventures. Maybe I should call the team and 
talk about it [laughs],” said Miyamoto. One year later at E3 2001, 
“Dinosaur Planet” would reappear as “Star Fox Adventures”.</p>
<p>Rare Ltd would have at least seven projects in development for 
Nintendo’s GameCube, but only “Star Fox Adventures” would actually 
release on the console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quest</li>
<li>Kameo: Elements of Power</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Racing</li>
<li>Perfect Dark Zero</li>
<li>Conker’s Other Bad Day</li>
<li>Star Fox Adventures</li>
<li>Grabbed by the Ghoulies</li>
</ul>
<p>On February 2000, Rareware <a title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/ken-lobb-on-perfect-dark-sequel-2761391" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/news/ken-lobb-on-perfect-dark-sequel-2761391">registered a domain address</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.velvetdark.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.velvetdark.com</a>
 which sparked discussion about whether Rare was working on a new 
Perfect Dark sequel. &nbsp;Six months later at Spaceworld 2000, Rare 
showed off a <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJD4wexCQ1I" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJD4wexCQ1I">GameCube tech demo</a> for Perfect Dark featuring a 3D model of Joanna Dark. Fast forward to Nintendo’s E3 2001 conference, reporters <a title="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ken-lobb-on-perfect-dark-sequel/1100-2761391/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ken-lobb-on-perfect-dark-sequel/1100-2761391/">asked Ken Lobb</a>
 about&nbsp;the possibility of a Perfect Dark sequel. Lobb replied, 
“It’s out there. We’re making it. No one will be disappointed.”</p>
<p>Around 2000, Rare was also&nbsp;<a title="http://www.unseen64.net/2009/04/07/quest-rareware-mmo-xbox-cancelled/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.unseen64.net/2009/04/07/quest-rareware-mmo-xbox-cancelled/">busy developing a project</a>
 called “Quest”, an multi-massive online RPG for the Nintendo GameCube. 
&nbsp;One year later, “Quest” would change direction and become a MMO 
Space shooter with&nbsp;Mark Edmonds programming, Duncan Botwood 
designing, and Chris Seavor handling the art direction. Nintendo’s 
online strategy for GameCube was still unclear at the time, but Rare 
continued developing the project anyways.</p>
<p>At E3 2001, three GameCube games developed by Rare were shown to the 
press: &nbsp;“Kameo: Elements of Power”, “Star Fox Adventures: Dinosaur 
Planet” (later renamed to just “Star Fox Adventures”), and “Donkey Kong 
Racing”.&nbsp;I asked Lee Musgrave, lead designer of Donkey Kong Racing,
 why we only saw a CGI video but never any actual gameplay. 
&nbsp;Musgrave told me that “Donkey Kong Racing” was in an early 
prototype stage with playable gameplay, and he explained to me how the 
game would have worked.</p>
<p>“Ha! – yes, I made that [E3 2001 CGI video]! . . . Donkey Kong Racing
 was obviously pretty heavily tied to Nintendo as a franchise, and as 
Rare approached the finalization of a buyout deal with Microsoft it was 
clear that the game had no future, at least with&nbsp;<em>the ape’s</em>&nbsp;as characters,” said Musgrave.</p>
<p>“[Donkey Kong Racing] was a pure racing game, the underlying software
 mechanics were actually based on car physics, but it also incorporated 
the idea of riders jumping between different animals mid-race, to always
 be riding the ones that were bigger or faster . . . <strong>we had some awesome gameplay in place, and it was lots of fun</strong> – <strong>we even had a multiplayer version working</strong> – and when you fell off, you had to tap-tap-tap (HyperSports style) to run on foot and catch up with an animal,” said Musgrave.</p>
<p>In December 2001, Rare Ltd. sent out Christmas cards featuring a 
Christmas tree with presents wrapped in the shapes of GameCube, 
PlayStation 2, and Xbox. &nbsp;The card’s message read “…and surprises 
under every tree”. The card sparked rumors across the internet with 
insiders claiming that the company had development kits for Xbox and 
PlayStation 2 in their possession.&nbsp;Tim and Chris Stamper, the 
founders of Rare, were interested in selling their company to a third 
party publisher so they could publish on multiple platforms. &nbsp;The 
U.K. developer&nbsp;approached major U.S. publishers such as Activision,
 Electronic Arts, and Disney about acquiring them.</p>

<p>Nintendo owned half of Rare Ltd, and they had already extended their 
option to acquire Rare by one year. Unfortunately, the aggressive 
bidding war between Activision and Microsoft reached a point where 
Nintendo didn’t want to be involved anymore. &nbsp;The deal with 
Activision eventually broke off, and Microsoft was looking to swoop in 
and grab the company for themselves.</p>
<p>Microsoft Game Studios Ed Fries&nbsp;<a title=" http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-08-who-killed-rare" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-08-who-killed-rare">explained to Eurogamer</a>,
 “If they [Nintendo] didn’t exercise that option then Rare had the 
option to find a buyer for Nintendo’s half. Nintendo had already 
extended the option by one year, but it looked like they weren’t going 
to acquire the other half of Rare, so the Rare guys started looking 
around to see if anyone else might be interested. We were a logical 
choice for them to call.”</p>
<p>Although Microsoft was the highest bidder to purchase Rare, Nintendo 
still had the priority option to purchase the company. To prevent 
Nintendo from buying Rare, Microsoft <a title="http://www.develop-online.net/news/activision-s-deal-to-steal-rare-collapsed/0108032" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.develop-online.net/news/activision-s-deal-to-steal-rare-collapsed/0108032">raised their bid</a> as high as possible so Nintendo wouldn’t be able to match it.</p>
<p>“Still at this point, Nintendo had the priority option to buy the 
other half of Rare at the price we were offering.&nbsp;So, there’s a 
problem; if we drive a hard bargain and put in a low price for Rare, 
Nintendo would have the chance to buy at that low price and probably 
would. So, the price was high,” said Fries.</p>
<p>On September 24th, 2002, Microsoft paid $375 million to Nintendo to 
own 100% of the company. &nbsp;Rare would now become a first party 
developer for Microsoft, and games like “Donkey Kong Racing” would end 
up in limbo.&nbsp;Martin Hollis, the producer of Goldeneye, explained 
that it was Hiroshi Yamauchi who shrewdly declined the offer.</p>
<p>“In the end&nbsp;I understand Mr Yamauchi [Nintendo’s President] 
declined to offer more than a fraction of the value Rare was asking; 
shrewdly, it would seem.&nbsp;Meanwhile Microsoft had a strategic reason
 to buy, two reasons really: firstly so Nintendo would not have Rare’s 
games, and secondly so that Microsoft would,” said Hollis</p>
<p>Nintendo’s George Harrison <a title="http://www.slicedgaming.com/news/egm-interviews-george-harrison-2803.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.slicedgaming.com/news/egm-interviews-george-harrison-2803.html">explained to Electronic Gaming Monthly</a> that Rareware hurt GameCube’s momentum by&nbsp;<a title="http://www.slicedgaming.com/news/egm-interviews-george-harrison-2803.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.slicedgaming.com/news/egm-interviews-george-harrison-2803.html">failing to deliver</a>
 any games within the launch window. &nbsp;This was compounded by the 
fact that Rare Ltd. was one of the first studios to receive development 
kits.</p>
<p>“…when we launched the GameCube, we put the concentration of our 
development kits in the hands of only a few people — internally, of 
course, with Mr. Miyamoto’s EAD team, but also with Rare.&nbsp;<strong>And
 Rare didn’t deliver a single game for us at the launch, when their 
history had been to make some really great games for us in the past. 
That hurt us, and it led us into this gap of titles, starting after the 
launch and lasting for about seven or nine months until Mario Sunshine 
came out.</strong>&nbsp;Consumers want consistency. They would never buy
 a DVD player that had only one or two good movies a year; they want 
consistency and variety, and we’re trying hard to make sure that’s not 
only resolved for the GameCube, but as we go into the next system,” said
 Harrison</p>
<p>Harrison’s comments weren’t the first time that Rareware was blamed 
for hurting GameCube’s momentum. When Nintendo of America’s Jasmine 
Ramya&nbsp;was asked about why Nintendo was no longer working with&nbsp;<strong>Rare</strong>,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=33" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=33">this was the answer given</a>:</p>
<p>“Although Nintendo doesn’t comment on rumors or speculation by the 
media, we can tell you that Nintendo has made the decision not to 
request Rare to make any further exclusive games for the Nintendo 
GameCube. Although we’re proud of our joint efforts with Rare over the 
years and have enjoyed our relationship with them, in fiscal year 2001, 
Rare accounted for only 9.5% of total Nintendo software revenue 
worldwide. In fiscal year 2002, that number declined to 1.5%. Therefore,
 in evaluating our investments in developers, as well as the financial 
benefits to Nintendo over the years, we’ve decided it’s in Nintendo’s 
best interests to focus on diversifying our portfolio of developers and 
projects,” said Ramya.</p>
<p>Both responses seemed unusual for a company that stresses quality 
over quantity. At the same time, Microsoft had jacked up the bidding 
price so high that Nintendo would be forced to decline the offer. 
Employees at Rareware seemed happy with the buyout since Microsoft’s 
ownership would mean financial stability for the studio. But that 
financial stability would come at the cost of killing creativity and 
cancelling projects.</p>
<p>A Rare employee <a title="http://www.gamekult.com/forum/topic-interview-dun-ex-employe-de-rareware-227056n.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamekult.com/forum/topic-interview-dun-ex-employe-de-rareware-227056n.html">told Gamekult</a>,
 “Several of us just got fed up, so we left. Beating down our creativity
 was definitely part of it, but it’s more than that. It’s more like 
having a strict parent telling you don’t do this and don’t do that. It’s
 just the environment there. Guess we should have been careful what we 
wished for.&nbsp;I guess we saw the grass as being greener with 
Microsoft coming in. Nintendo had always been strict with our compliance
 to their ideas or standards as they would call it. We figured things 
would be better after the deal went through,” the employee continues. “<span style="line-height:1.5em;">Microsoft
 is much stricter, the my way or the highway type. Nintendo was more of 
the this is how you should do it. You don’t have to, but we highly 
recommend you do. Highly recommend.”</span></p>
<p>In 2012, I spoke to former Rareware employee Don Murphy about the 
Rareware/Microsoft acquisition. &nbsp;He had worked on games such as 
“Conker’s Bad Fur Day”, “Killer Instinct”, and “Perfect Dark Zero”. 
Murphy says Microsoft bought the company because they only had the 
hardcore shooter market, and Rare would help the Xbox brand reach a 
broader, family friendly market.</p>
<p id="yui_3_2_0_1_1345571583287169">Murphy says, “At first it seemed 
that they wouldn’t interfere much, but it was soon clear that they were 
more interested in&nbsp;using Rare to help aim at a younger market. This
 stifled a lot of creativity, Rare was renowned for their diverse 
portfolio, so to not be involved in making&nbsp;Mature games was a real 
blow.&nbsp;When the stampers left it seemed that Microsoft was losing 
faith in Rare, it was hard to take when all around were incredibly 
talented people, with massive amounts of experience. There [were] 
numerous projects that were put forward that I&nbsp;believe 
would&nbsp;have been huge hits, but MS rejected them one after the 
other. I remember seeing a couple of prototypes that Chris Seavor had 
designed and was working on, that looked amazing, but alas they got 
shelved. It seemed that MS didn’t want to take the risk in Rare doing 
anything outside the younger demographic, they quickly forgot the 
company’s heritage. We started to lose a lot of great talent then, 
people were losing job satisfaction, so they just left.”</p>
<p>Murphy was not the only person who believed the atmosphere at Rare 
had severely changed after the Microsoft acquisition.&nbsp;Phil Tossel, 
another former Rare developer, had worked on games such as “Diddy Kong 
Racing” and “Dinosaur Planet”. Tosell <a title="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-08-who-killed-rare" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-08-who-killed-rare">told Eurogamer</a>,
 “For me personally, the atmosphere became much more stifling and a lot 
more stressful.&nbsp;There was an overall feeling that you weren’t 
really in control of what you were doing and that you weren’t really 
trusted either.”</p>
<p>When I <a title="http://www.dromble.com/2012/10/01/crash-lab-life-after-rareware-and-free-radical/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.dromble.com/2012/10/01/crash-lab-life-after-rareware-and-free-radical/">asked Lee Musgrave</a>&nbsp;in
 2012 why he left Rare, he said one reason was because there had been 
less emphasis being on placed on attention to detail to make games 
great, and more emphasis on just getting things ‘done’.</p>
<p>“I’d been there for 17 years by the time I left and by the end, the 
Rare I joined had gone. I don’t really attribute that to anything that 
Microsoft did, but the simple migration to becoming part of a mammoth 
organisation inevitably changes the atmosphere of a hitherto insular 
place like Rare. Some of the people embraced the corporate culture 
whilst others, like me, felt that there 
was&nbsp;not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;emphasis being placed on real attention to
 detail or iteration of ideas/features in order to make them great, 
rather than just being ‘done’ and able to be ticked from a list,” said 
Musgrave.</p>
<p>The biggest internet myth is that Nintendo wasn’t interested in buying the other 50% of Rare. &nbsp;Nintendo <strong>wanted to buy</strong>
 the other half of Rare, and that’s why they asked for a one year 
extension to look over all of their options. The problem is Rare’s 
founders wanted a giant bidding war between Microsoft, Nintendo, and 
Activision to boost the value of their company. &nbsp;When comparing 
financial investments, the price of Retro Studios ($1 million) was a 
drop in the bucket compared to the $300 million that companies were 
bidding to buy Rare Ltd.</p>

<h1><strong>Online Gaming vs. GCN/GBA Connectivity</strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.notenoughshaders.com/?attachment_id=10088" rel="attachment wp-att-10088"><img src="A%20Dolphin%E2%80%99s%20Tale%20%20The%20Story%20of%20GameCube%20%E2%80%93%20Dromble_files/broadband-adapter.jpg" alt="broadband adapter" height="263" width="440"></a></p>
<p>The Sega Dreamcast’s online capabilities were gaining popularity with
 software such as Phantasy Star Online, Sega Sports, and Quake III 
Arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sega even launched the internet service “SegaNet” in 
2000 which offered a $200 rebate with a two-year contract to encourage 
sales of the Dreamcast. Even though Sega heavily promoted their online 
capabilities, Sony promised that PlayStation 2 would offer an online 
network similar to the film, “<strong>The Matrix”</strong>.</p>
<p>Ken Kutaragi, the creator of the PlayStation,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2000/03/05/here-comes-playstation-2.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2000/03/05/here-comes-playstation-2.html">tells Newsweek</a>,”You
 can communicate to a new cybercity.&nbsp;This will be the ideal home 
server. Did you see the movie ‘The Matrix’? Same interface. Same 
concept. Starting from next year, you can jack into ‘The Matrix’!”</p>
<p>Sony wasn’t the only company preparing an online network at the time.
 &nbsp;Nintendo was working on network capabilities for their 
next-generation console, and <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3">IGN’s sources</a>
 at Nintendo of America suggested that online was at the top of their 
priority list. &nbsp;The information claimed that Nintendo had entered 
into an agreement with Nexus to develop Dolphin’s networking and modem 
capabilities. There were also rumblings of Nintendo being involved with 
Netscape, Alps, and some modem makers. &nbsp;Nintendo planned for their 
next generation console to be used for network gaming, internet surfing,
 and checking your email.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto <a title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/miyamoto-talks-dolphin-at-space-world-and14599-2460819" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/news/miyamoto-talks-dolphin-at-space-world-and14599-2460819">told GameSpot</a>&nbsp;“<strong>There’s
 got to be something Dolphin has with the Internet, because from now on 
we can’t create entertainment without thinking about network 
communication.</strong>&nbsp;At the same time, we are an entertainment 
company so we have to take into consideration the cost associated with 
network games, and the ages of the users, who are actually going to make
 use of it. If we consider these two points right now, I have to tell 
you that there is not a big market right now for Dolphin to involve a 
significant Internet business. Nintendo, as an entertainment company has
 a responsibility to parents and children so that the parents can always
 feel secure to provide their children with Nintendo machines, hardware 
and software. So because of that I don’t think network capabilities will
 be the core of the Dolphin project.”</p>
<p>Six months later, on February 2000, Shigeru Miyamoto said he 
understood how enthusiastic gamers were about online gaming, but 
Nintendo was only interested in online gaming if there was a new way to 
approach it.</p>
<p>“I’m very interested in online gaming, and I fully understand why people are so enthusiastic about it,” said Miyamoto. “But, <strong>you know what</strong> <strong>Nintendo is about, and has always been about, is NOT doing the same as every other company.</strong>
 So, if it ever came to the stage where we were talking about online 
gaming, it would be because we had a new way to approach the idea. It 
wouldn’t just be because everyone else is doing it.”</p>
<p>Later that year, Nintendo’s Hiroshi Yamauchi <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/08/yamauchi-confirms-dolphin-delay-internet-plans" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/08/yamauchi-confirms-dolphin-delay-internet-plans">confirmed internet plans</a>&nbsp;for the Dolphin.</p>
<p>“[The Dolphin] will have a function to access the Internet,” said 
Yamauchi. “We are entering the market as a latecomer so the console will
 have to outperform Sony Corp.’s PlayStation2. We are planning to 
introduce an Internet business next March or April. The first step will 
be online sales of a brand new type of Pokemon cards.”</p>
<p>On August 2000, Genyo Takeda, Nintendo’s&nbsp;general manager of integrated&nbsp;research and development, <a title="http://www.neoseeker.com/news/667-dialup-dolphin/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/667-dialup-dolphin/">announced that Nintendo had signed a deal</a>
 to use Conexant’s modem technology with the Dolphin. Thanks to 
Conexant’s technology, Dolphin users could play online multiplayer 
against each other through a Broadband internet connection.</p>
<p>“Dolphin will combine Nintendo’s world-class design and beloved 
franchise characters with the expansion of the world of gaming by an 
online network,” said Genyo Takeda.&nbsp;“Conexant’s modem technology 
will connect Dolphin users to both the Internet and other gamers, 
creating a rich and dynamic entertainment experience. We are also 
excited about working with Conexant to bring broadband connectivity to 
our powerful new gaming platform.”</p>
<p>Matt Rhodes, senior vice president for Conexant’s Personal&nbsp;Computing&nbsp;Division, <a title="http://www.neoseeker.com/news/667-dialup-dolphin/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/667-dialup-dolphin/">released a statement,</a>&nbsp;“Conexant
 is pleased to be contributing our modem technology to Nintendo’s 
exciting new video game console.&nbsp;Conexant helped to re-shape 
personal computing in the 1990s with our low-cost, dial-up modem 
technology for Internet access and online connectivity, and now we are 
helping industry-leading consumer companies like Nintendo do the same 
for video gaming.”</p>
<p>Before Dolphin [GameCube] could even launch, Hiroshi Yamauchi’s attitude toward online gaming grew cold. The company <a title="http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/crontab/t-5575.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.consolecity.com/forum/archive/index.php/crontab/t-5575.html">became skeptical</a> of whether online gaming would be profitable for the GameCube business.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“The Internet games available today 
are for hard-core gamers. I don’t believe the general public is going to
 be very interested in them,” said Hiroshi Yamauchi. “And I doubt that 
Net games will turn out to be profitable. There is only interest in 
these games because NTT DoCoMo Inc has profited from i-mode. I am not 
sure if content providers have made any money. Unless the business 
proves profitable, Nintendo will not be involved in Internet games.”</span></p>
<p>Soon, the entire company shared Yamauchi’s skepticism, and the belief
 at Nintendo was online gaming is just pure hype and nothing 
more.&nbsp;Shigeru Miyamoto, someone who was once excited about 
Dolphin’s online capabilities, said he <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6498" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6498">didn’t think most developers</a> had any original ideas of how to push online gaming into new territory.</p>
<p><b>“</b>We’re always aware of the technologies available, like online
 gaming. But we’re very skeptical about the business side of online 
gaming. &nbsp;Many people who have said in the past that online gaming 
is the wave of the future have to sit and face the reality now about how
 to turn this into a viable business,” said Shigeru Miyamoto. “I’m 
interested in the future of online gaming. But looking at the situation 
honestly, I think a lot of the talk is just hype, and isn’t backed up by
 really new ideas on how to use the technology. &nbsp;However, we’re 
always making preparations for this business. Actually, I am more 
interested in the broader concept of communication in games, of which 
the online play aspect is just a part.”</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata <a title="http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/090601a.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/090601a.html">told an interviewer</a>
 that there were several barriers for online gaming. &nbsp;One of those 
barriers is that narrowband players need to have a telephone line, and 
since most of GameCube’s owners are children, they don’t have credit 
cards to subscribe to a network and pay monthly fees. &nbsp;“We believe a
 game that might sell 1 million copies normally would likely sell less 
than 200,000 copies if it was network based,” said Iwata.</p>
<p>Although Nintendo’s excitement for online gaming was cooling down, GameSpy <a title="http://www.neoseeker.com/news/1558-gamespy-supports-nintendo-gamecube-online-gaming-plans/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/1558-gamespy-supports-nintendo-gamecube-online-gaming-plans/">announced middleware tools</a>
 for game developments to enable a low-cost turnkey online gaming 
solution. &nbsp;The tools would help GameCube developers reduce the cost
 and time to make their GameCube games have online functionality. 
&nbsp;Some of the functionality included in-game player matchmaking, 
text chat, buddy lists, online competitions, high score ladders, online 
data storage, game statistics reporting and data transfers. &nbsp;For 
$995, GameCube developers could purchase a GameSpy Developer Toolbox 
which provided SDK source code, documentation, and sample applications.</p>
<p>Another <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/10/nintendo-chooses-aol-for-gcn-online" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/10/nintendo-chooses-aol-for-gcn-online">announcement involved America Online</a>
 who struck a deal with Nintendo of America to become the official 
preferred Internet Service Provider for GameCube. &nbsp;The agreement 
granted GameCube developers with licensed AOL connectivity software to 
enable their games to connect online. &nbsp;Through AOL’s part of the 
agreement, Nintendo products would be highlighted on AOL and AOL Time 
Warner websites, and AOL demo disks would be bundled with GameCube 
consoles. &nbsp;The company reaffirmed it’s stance on online gaming that
 they weren’t developing any online GameCube titles.&nbsp;“To be clear, 
this does not indicate the unveiling of a new online gaming approach 
from Nintendo. Nor does it signify that we have changed our position on 
the current business viability in the online console gaming field,” said
 Nintendo.</p>
<p>With Microsoft and Sony both pushing online networks, Nintendo’s GameCube would be the only console <strong>without</strong> an aggressive online strategy. Satoru Iwata told <a title="http://forum.beyond3d.com/showthread.php?t=11822" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://forum.beyond3d.com/showthread.php?t=11822">a Japanese publication</a>
 that Sony’s offline games were selling much better than their online 
titles, and this was proof that consumers do not have any interest in 
online connections at the moment.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“SCEI’s online golf game didn’t sell
 well, while its off-line golf game sold one million copies. This was 
also proof that customers do not want online games,” said Satoru Iwata. 
“Online technology has its own interesting features, so I don’t rule out
 the possibility of making use of it for games. But, at the moment, most
 customers do not wish to pay the extra money for connection to the 
Internet, and for some customers, connection procedures to the Internet 
are still not easy.”</span></p>
<p>Iwata further explains, “Some time ago, game companies as well as the
 media were predicting that online games would take off in the future. 
But&nbsp;game companies now find it difficult to make online game 
businesses successful, and their enthusiasm for them is cooling. During 
the year-end shopping season last year, none of the online games 
succeeded. The failure of SCEI’s golf game was a good example. All the 
games that sold well were off-line games.”</p>
<p>In an E3 2004 interview with the Herald Sun, Satoru Iwata was asked about the success of Xbox Live. &nbsp;Satoru Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/7951" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/7951">shrugged it off </a>&nbsp;and said Microsoft’s number of subscribers is too low to call it a success.</p>
<p>“One million Xbox Live subscribers? We don’t say that is successful. If it&nbsp;were a console, that would be a total<strong> failure</strong>.
 However, I believe networked&nbsp;platforms will become a very 
important part of gaming. When the time comes,&nbsp;that will be a very 
important way of Nintendo doing business,” said Satoru Iwata.</p>
<p>Each time Satoru Iwata did an interview with the press, the subject 
of online gaming would rear its head. &nbsp;As you can imagine, Iwata 
became increasingly annoyed with answering the same question over and 
over. He <a title="http://spong.com/article/4252/Iwata-on-mergers-online-and-the-GameCube-battle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/4252/Iwata-on-mergers-online-and-the-GameCube-battle">slammed critics</a> who claimed that Nintendo couldn’t survive as a business unless they embraced online gaming as the future.</p>
<p>“All the talk in the industry regarding online gaming has been 
misleading. Network swindlers have made it seem like companies can’t 
survive in this business without network compatibility,” said Iwata. 
“That’s the same type of rhetoric people have been saying about the 
newspaper business, that the paper-based periodical business will be 
dead in three years. In reality, the number of users willing to pay a 
monthly fee for online games is small. Many of the American companies 
who were focusing almost exclusively on network games last year now view
 network capabilities as an advertising tool. The fact of the matter is,
 network games can’t provide a stable source of profit for a company of 
Nintendo’s scale.”</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on online connectivity, Nintendo wanted to 
differentiate themselves from their competitors by emphasizing 
connectivity between the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance. Miyamoto 
used Animal Crossing as an example of a game that pushes communication 
in a video game without relying on online. Unfortunately, the idea of 
GCN/GBA connectivity never caught much fire, and it slowly faded away as
 time went on.</p>
<p>“You can see that communication between players increases enjoyment 
of the game,” he said. “But I think communication is a kind of fun 
that’s not something the developer creates, but draws out. Online is not
 the only type of communication, but that’s the one everyone has focused
 on –&nbsp;<strong>and I think that’s sad,</strong>” Shigeru Miyamoto told CNN <a title="http://money.cnn.com/2002/03/06/technology/column_gaming/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/2002/03/06/technology/column_gaming/">in an interview</a>.
 “Online gaming, like using violence in games, is just one method of 
introducing gaming to the public. And there are other methods that can 
be used.” In a separate interview <a title="http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/11/business/fi-techqa11" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/11/business/fi-techqa11">with the LA Times</a>,
 Miyamoto didn’t understand why so many game designers were focusing so 
much on online. &nbsp;He believed there were still many types of games 
that gamers preferred playing by themselves.</p>
<p>Would Nintendo’s conservative approach to online gaming with the 
GameCube place the company in a disadvantage with future next generation
 consoles? &nbsp;If Nintendo takes too long to create a sophisticated 
online network, would it become too difficult to catch up with Microsoft
 and Sony in this area? &nbsp;This was a question that <a title="http://forum.dvdtalk.com/archive/t-326842.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://forum.dvdtalk.com/archive/t-326842.html">Electronic Gaming Monthly asked</a> Nintendo of America’s George Harrison in 2004.</p>
<div>
<p>“If we look at the situation as it stands today, we’ve got about 30 
million systems sold between the PS2, Xbox and GameCube, and about a 
million and a half people have actually bought an online service — about
 a million for Sony and half a million for Xbox.&nbsp;<b>So that’s about
 five percent of the hardware install base that spent the money to get 
involved. Most of those people have yet to spend any money on a monthly 
or annual basis for a subscription,”&nbsp;</b>said Harrison.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012 where Nintendo is preparing to launch their 
next-gen console Wii U. Because Sony and Microsoft have been building 
their online networks for years, Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/353614/iwata-xbox-live-and-psn-are-too-far-developed-for-nintendo-to-catch-up/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/353614/iwata-xbox-live-and-psn-are-too-far-developed-for-nintendo-to-catch-up/">says it wouldn’t be easy</a>&nbsp;to catch up to their online networks.</p>
<p>“I think that what we see in terms of online gaming networks on 
existing dedicated gaming platforms is not particularly well suited to 
the approach Nintendo has taken.&nbsp;Therefore, I can’t sit here and 
say to you that we can very quickly overcome or catch up to other 
companies,<b>&nbsp;which began to work in the online field from many 
years ago and have been building these online networks on other 
platforms,</b>&nbsp;and I don’t think that would be a smart strategy, either.”</p>
<p>The conservative stance on online gaming made sense in 2001 because 
broadband connectivity wasn’t nearly as widespread as it is today. But 
while Nintendo spent years playing catch-up with online, their 
competitors have been using online services to make consumers more loyal
 to their brands. &nbsp;After twelve years, Nintendo would finally 
launch the Nintendo Network,&nbsp;<b>but did they wait too long</b>? 
Would most gamers switch to the Nintendo Network after they’ve spent 
over a decade making tons of friends, invested lots of money, and 
collected plenty of trophies and achievements on Xbox Live and 
PlayStation Network? That’s the million dollar question whenever we 
discuss the strategy of Nintendo’s online business.</p>

The&nbsp;<a title="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/21/business/fi-video21" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/21/business/fi-video21">survey found</a>&nbsp;that
 the popularity of video games among Japanese children had slipped from 
fifth place in 1995 to ninth place in 2000. Nintendo was preparing to 
launch the GameCube — a console designed with small children in mind — 
one year after research suggested that Japanese children were losing 
interest in games.&nbsp;Over&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130437/lost_in_translationjapanese_and_.php?print=1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130437/lost_in_translationjapanese_and_.php?print=1">at Gamasutra</a>,
 InterOne Inc’s John Ricciardi talked about the gaming scene in early 
2000’s Japan. He talks about there being a huge divide in how Japanese 
developers are paid in comparison to developers in the west. Based on 
his own observations, he noticed that most Japanese people who own a 
GameCube were usually small children.</p>
<p>“Xbox gamers in Japan are mostly super hardcore types, and GameCube 
owners are mostly kids–I hate to play into the stereotype, but it’s 
really true,” said Ricciardi.&nbsp;“Another point that I’m sure many of 
my friends in development out here would love for me to point out:&nbsp;<strong>Japanese developers get paid like garbage compared to Western developers.</strong>&nbsp;Programmers
 and artists here, even high-level ones, make a fraction of what their 
counterparts make in the West. This can’t possibly be good for morale, 
but at the same time it’s kind of normal for Japan; employees here are 
expected to be loyal to their company and treat it like a second home, 
so most people don’t complain about these kinds of issues as much as 
they probably should.”</p>
<p>Japan’s economy was greatly impacting the game industry during the 
early 2000’s, and the used game market was only making the situation 
worse. &nbsp;Speaking with&nbsp;<a title="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-04-24/business/0404240243_1_game-sales-gaming-market-entertainment-software-association" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-04-24/business/0404240243_1_game-sales-gaming-market-entertainment-software-association">the Chicago Tribute</a>, KOEI president Kiyoshi Komatsu voiced concerns about the gaming market in Japan.</p>
<p>“First of all, the Japanese economy is not doing well. The shrinking 
of the game market is a natural extension of the bad economy,” said 
Kiyoshi Komatsu, president of KOEI.&nbsp;“…the used-game market in Japan
 is quite a problem. Roughly 30 to 40 percent of the market is used 
games. Obviously, this situation with used games affects the income of 
softwaremakers like us.”</p>
<p>Square Enix’s president, Yoichi Wada, said one reason Japanese publishers struggled in the early 2000’s is because they&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ddrfreak.com/newpress/Japan-U_S_%20divide%20splits%20video%20game%20industry.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ddrfreak.com/newpress/Japan-U_S_%20divide%20splits%20video%20game%20industry.htm">didn’t properly promote</a>&nbsp;their
 games.&nbsp;“Japanese game publishers have been bad at marketing, 
ourselves included,” said Square Enix President Yoichi Wada.</p>
<p>By 2003, the&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/japanese-gaming-population-rising-market-falling/1100-6094601/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/japanese-gaming-population-rising-market-falling/1100-6094601/">CESA reported</a>&nbsp;that
 37 percent (34.4 million) of the Japanese population actively played 
games in 2003. &nbsp;This was a 12 percent increase from 25.6 percent 
(23.6 million)&nbsp;in 2002. &nbsp;But here’s where things get&nbsp;<strong>problematic</strong>.
 &nbsp;Although more people in Japan claimed to be playing video games 
than before, they weren’t spending as much money on video games like in 
the past. &nbsp;According to the CESA’s report, the Japanese market 
declined to 446.2 billion yen ($4.11 billion) in 2003, an 11 percent 
decrease from 2002, and only 60 percent of its peak in 1997. Hardware 
sales in Japan&nbsp;<a title="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/japanese-gaming-population-rising-market-falling/1100-6094601/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/japanese-gaming-population-rising-market-falling/1100-6094601/">declined 16.7 percent</a>&nbsp;in 2003 while software sales declined 8.2 percent that year.</p>
<p>“Japan’s marketplace is the only one shrinking right now,” said 
Yoshihiro Maruyama, the general manager of Xbox’s Japanese division. 
Maruyama&nbsp;<a title="http://www.1up.com/features/xbox-sucks-japan" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.1up.com/features/xbox-sucks-japan">told 1UP.com</a>,
 “I think software makers are feeling the heat, too. Publishers, 
distributors, and users are all unhappy, and I want that to change.”</p>
<p>In the United States, the&nbsp;<a title="http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/18/technology/gamesales/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/18/technology/gamesales/">NPD Group told CNN</a>&nbsp;that
 sales for the video game industry had increased 8% in 
2004.&nbsp;Although the industry’s U.S sales remained strong, Nintendo’s
 president Satoru Iwata became increasingly worried about the state of 
the Japanese market.</p>
<p>“We have learned that people get tired of any entertainment form,” Satoru Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/20/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/20/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/">told CNN</a>.
 “In Japan, the gaming market is shrinking. There is still room to 
expand in the U.S. and Europe. But we should not become complacent with 
that growth.”</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata stated that the reasoning for declining software sales in Japan is due to gamers no longer wanting&nbsp;<strong>long</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>difficult</strong>&nbsp;games.</p>
<p>“Also behind the soft sales is a change in consumer trends. Consumers
 today apparently don’t want to sit in front of the television to play 
games for hours and hours,” Satoru Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://spong.com/article/4300/Iwata-speaks-on-disappointing-GameCube-sales" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/4300/Iwata-speaks-on-disappointing-GameCube-sales">explained</a>. Speaking to&nbsp;<a title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/08/08/nintendo_halts_gamecube_flow/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/08/08/nintendo_halts_gamecube_flow/">the Register</a>,
 Iwata blamed declining game sales on “overly complex titles that are 
too tough for newcomers and casual gamers”. He told the Register that 
long, difficult games are bad for business because “gamers can spend 
months playing them, and while they’re doing so, they’re not buying 
other titles. Those who find they can’t win get so fed up with the 
experience, they don’t feel inclined to buy an alternative title.”</p>
<p>The Register&nbsp;<a title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/08/08/nintendo_halts_gamecube_flow/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/08/08/nintendo_halts_gamecube_flow/">explains</a>,
 “Nintendo’s message to the industry seems to be: forget about discs jam
 packed with ever more complex levels and involving gameplay, and give 
the punters something they can complete quicky – and get out to buy more
 of the stuff. Iwata wants Nintendo to focus on games that have a 
broader appeal.”</p>
<p>Nintendo of America’s George Harrison <a title="http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/">told CNN</a>
 that GameCube’s software sales were lower than expected because games 
like “Super Mario Sunshine” are too difficult for today’s gamers. 
&nbsp;Due to software sales, Nintendo of Japan and Miyamoto have decided
 to make games less challenging to sell software to larger audiences.</p>
<p>“Nintendo’s chief gaming architect Shigeru Miyamoto agreed with 
criticism that the Mario game was too hard. And, in a decision that 
might anger the hardcore crowd, the word has since come from up high to 
make games less challenging.” <a title="http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/">said CNN</a>.</p>

<p>On March 2003, U.K. retailer chain Dixons decided to <a title="http://www.geek.com/games/major-uk-retailer-dixons-dumps-gamecube-553046/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.geek.com/games/major-uk-retailer-dixons-dumps-gamecube-553046/">remove GameCube consoles</a>, accessories, and games from its shelves. Argos, another U.K. retailer, <a title="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47584" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47584">decided to cut the price</a>
 of GameCube to £78.99 which would be over £50 cheaper than Nintendo’s 
standard retail price. Dixon also raised the possibility of dropping 
GameCube altogether if sales don’t improve.&nbsp;“Sales have been slow 
so we wanted to speed these up by selling it at a good price,” according
 to Argos marketing director Paul Geddes. “In terms of what happens 
after that, we haven’t yet taken a decision on the format.”</p>
<p>The GameCube’s sales were also hurting in Japan. &nbsp;Major 
deflation was hitting Japan that year with stocks trading at 20-year 
lows and real estate prices down 80% from their value a few years ago, 
For the fourth straight year, consumer prices had fallen, wages dropped 
2.1%, and unemployment was on the rise.&nbsp;Nintendo’s President Satoru
 Iwata <a title="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-05-25/deflation-nation" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-05-25/deflation-nation">told Bloomberg</a>
 that GameCube was too expensive for most Japanese 
families.&nbsp;“Japanese are waiting for the price to come down. 
Spending more than 20,000 yen ($170) is a heavy outlay for a Japanese 
family today,” said Iwata.</p>
<p>When <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/9634" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/9634">asked about why</a>
 the console had become irrelevant in Australia, Satoru Iwata 
replied,&nbsp;“First of all, I am most sorry that the Gamecube’s 
performance is bad in Australia among any area in the world. One of the 
biggest things I feel unfortunate about is that I have not been to 
Australia. I am looking forward to learning more about Australia.”</p>
<p>By August 2003, Nintendo’s <a title="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aE00U63dING0" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aE00U63dING0">full year profits</a> fell by 38% due to GameCube’s low sales. &nbsp;The company would only <a title="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aE00U63dING0" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aE00U63dING0">sell an estimated&nbsp;5.6 million GameCubes</a> in the fiscal year which would be 44 percent short of Satoru Iwata’s 10 million unit goal. &nbsp;Satoru Iwata <a title="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/08/01/346319/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/08/01/346319/">admitted to CNN</a> that his rival’s vision for the future of the industry was <strong>bringing a “sense of crisis on us”</strong>, but he remained optimistic for the future of his company.&nbsp;Nintendo of America’s president Satoru Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-06-01/the-rough-play-in-video-games" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-06-01/the-rough-play-in-video-games">conceded that 2003 was a rough year for the company</a>. &nbsp;GameCube’s sales were not living up to expectations, and third party publishers were losing their patience.</p>
<p>“But then, that’s what I enjoy,” said Iwata, who was 43 years old 
that year. &nbsp;“We need to feel a sense of crisis to bring out the 
best in us.”</p>
<p>Satoru Iwata <a title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/060607qa/02.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/060607qa/02.html">admitted that GameCube’s <strong>launch</strong> sales</a>
 were good, but they failed to maintain the momentum.&nbsp;“When we 
launched GameCube, the initial sales were good, and all the hardware we 
manufactured at that time were sold through. However, after this period,
 we could not provide the market with strong software titles in a timely
 fashion. As a result we could not leverage the initial launch time 
momentum, and sales of GameCube slowed down,” said Iwata.</p>
<p>Iwata&nbsp;<a title="http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-chief-sets-sights-on-software/123311" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.zdnet.com/news/nintendo-chief-sets-sights-on-software/123311">told investors</a>
 that Nintendo would&nbsp;sell 50 million&nbsp;GameCube 
consoles&nbsp;worldwide by&nbsp;March 2005.&nbsp;GameCube only&nbsp;sold
 21.7 million&nbsp;units worldwide by the&nbsp;end of 2006. &nbsp;The 
console didn’t even sell half of what the company had originally 
forecasted.</p>

<p>“One of the things we did with the GameCube was we had these big gaps
 in time and that really tested people’s patience,” Nintendo’s Perrin 
Kaplan <a title="http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/15/the-engadget-and-joystiq-interview-nintendos-perrin-kaplan/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/15/the-engadget-and-joystiq-interview-nintendos-perrin-kaplan/">admitted</a>&nbsp;to Engadget&nbsp;a few years later. &nbsp;Nintendo of America’s Beth Llewelyn <a title=" http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/invest/2001-05-24-nintendo-earnings.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/invest/2001-05-24-nintendo-earnings.htm">echoed Kaplan’s comments</a>. “We had to compete against games like&nbsp;<i>Grand Theft Auto</i>&nbsp;which probably stole some of the thunder away from our bigger titles,” said Llewelyn.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Sega found success with family 
friendly GameCube titles like “Sonic Adventure 2: Battle” &nbsp;and 
“Super Monkey Ball” which sold better than most of their games on PS2 
and Xbox.&nbsp;</span>Unfortunately, not everything was good news for 
Sega and the GameCube. The GameCube versions for every Sega Sports title
 sold significantly worse than the PS2 and Xbox versions. On January 
23rd, 2003, Sega Sports representatives <a title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/world-series-baseball-2k3-canceled-for-the-gamecube-2909525" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.gamespot.com/news/world-series-baseball-2k3-canceled-for-the-gamecube-2909525">confirmed to the press</a>
 that its upcoming baseball game, World Series Baseball 2K3, wouldn’t be
 coming to the Nintendo GameCube that year. The Xbox and PlayStation 2 
versions would remain on track to ship that upcoming March. A few months

<p>Acclaim, a publisher who was once part of the Ultra 64 “Dream Team” 
in 1995, had a great relationship with Nintendo. By 2003,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/92905/acclaim-drops-gamecube/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/92905/acclaim-drops-gamecube/">the relationship soured</a>, and Acclaim <strong>dropped </strong>its
 support for the Nintendo GameCube. &nbsp;With retailers dropping 
support for both GameCube hardware and software, Acclaim found itself 
under pressure to drop the console as well.</p>
<p>“We’re getting increasing negativity at retail just in pushing 
GameCube products. The reports we get from retailers are that the 
machine’s not selling, they’re not going to stock it, and they’re only 
going to stock the top three to five games, and they’re all going to be 
licensed or first party. This makes it increasingly difficult for us to 
make it viable to do any GameCube games. The main problem is, just 
looking across Europe, all the main territories that we deal with, the 
hardware sales and software sales just don’t make it viable for us to 
keep going with the ‘Cube. “There are some titles that will be published
 between now and Christmas on the ‘Cube – XGRA and Urban Freestyle 
Soccer will still be released. But as I say, it’s almost that the 
decision’s been made for us by the market.”</p>
<p>Eidos&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/05/eidos-to-pull-gcn-support" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/05/eidos-to-pull-gcn-support">announced to the press</a>
 that they were pulling support&nbsp;for the GameCube, and they told 
other publishers to follow their lead.&nbsp;“The GameCube is a declining
 business. If other companies follow us, [Nintendo] will have a hard 
battle to fight,”&nbsp;said Eido’s Chief Executive Mike McGarvey. He 
told the press that Eidos doesn’t normally invest heavily in Nintendo 
systems so this decision wouldn’t have any impact on their business.</p>
<p>Third parties took that advice. One by one, publishers began dropping
 their GameCube support like flies. At a Dutch event that same year 
(2003), Atari announced that Driver 3, Mission Impossible: Operation 
Surma, and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had all&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/24/atari-cancels-gamecube-titles" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/24/atari-cancels-gamecube-titles">been cancelled on the GameCube</a>&nbsp;and planned to axe other GameCube titles as well.</p>
<p>THQ followed Atari’s lead by cancelling the GameCube version of “The 
Suffering” and told the press that the game would still come to 
PlayStation 2 and Xbox. THQ explained to IGN, “We want to concentrate on
 the leading platforms in the marketplace when it comes to launching 
original product. We are still publishing titles like&nbsp;<em>Blitz</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Hitz</em>&nbsp;for the Nintendo GameCube, but for&nbsp;<em>The Suffering</em>&nbsp;we are concentrating on the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox.”</p>
<p>Jack Symons, director of marketing at Bam! Entertainment said, “I was
 surprised to hear that THQ and Activision have pulled back, 
particularly THQ. Some of their licenses like&nbsp;<i>Rugrats</i>&nbsp;and what not skew to the younger audience, which in theory, is more prevalent on GameCube.”</p>
<p>Midway would also&nbsp;<a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/27/mgd-2004-no-kombat-for-gamecube" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/27/mgd-2004-no-kombat-for-gamecube">revealed that it had no future plans for Gamecube</a>.
 “Mortal Kombat: Deception is not under development for GameCube,” a 
Midway representative said. “Midway is still selectively considering 
software for GameCube. However, there are no titles in development for 
the console at this time.”</p>
<p><strong>The chart below is the combined game sales of EA, Activision, Ubisoft, THQ, and Midway among all three consoles.</strong></p>
<p>Before Xbox 360 launched, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 1 made up&nbsp;<strong>90%</strong>&nbsp;of combined software sales.&nbsp;The other&nbsp;<strong>10%</strong>&nbsp;of combined game sales was GameCube.</p>

<p>Nintendo believed that their licensing fees were similar to what 
their competitors offered, but most publishers didn’t see it that way. 
With publishers abandoning the GameCube, Nintendo rushed to 
take&nbsp;action by <a title="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/89757/nintendo-snuggles-up-to-third-parties/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/89757/nintendo-snuggles-up-to-third-parties/">drastically lowering their royalty rate</a>,
 and promised to help publishers market their third party titles. George
 Harrison told CVG,”Before our royalty rate was a little more aggressive
 so to the third party publisher it was a little less attractive to make
 games for the GameCube.”</p>
<p>Speaking with Reuters,&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.5em;">Harrison also admitted that GameCube sales were hurt by not having <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> on their console.&nbsp;</span>“The
 biggest games of the year last year were games like GTA and they came 
from an independent publisher,” said Harrison. “We need to make sure 
that we have good relationships with all the independent publishers, 
because you never know where the next big hit game is going to come 
from.”</p>
<p>You could always sense disappointment from Shiguru Miyamoto whenever 
interviewers asked him questions about the problems facing GameCube. 
&nbsp;I’m not saying Mr. Miyamoto loses sleep over GameCube, but I don’t
 think he expected such a lukewarm reaction to all of the time, money, 
and hard work invested into that machine.&nbsp;In a 2001&nbsp;<a title="http://www.angelfire.com/biz6/alyhannigan/gaming.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.angelfire.com/biz6/alyhannigan/gaming.htm">Nintendo Dream Magazine interview</a>,
 Iwata said Miyamoto was so dedicated to GameCube that&nbsp;he refused 
to get away from work for even a day.&nbsp;When you fast forward to 
2004, the end of the GameCube era, Shigeru Miyamoto had spoken about the
 stress and pressure he was under.</p>
<p>“The stress sometimes really takes a toll on me physically, to the 
point even where&nbsp;I have developed some heart problems&nbsp;in the 
past.&nbsp;Apart from that and spiritually speaking, though, I always 
feel like I’ve been trying to fulfill myself and make myself happy 
here,”&nbsp;Miyamoto&nbsp;<a title="http://www.the-nextlevel.com/features/interviews/shigeru-miyamoto/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.the-nextlevel.com/features/interviews/shigeru-miyamoto/">explained</a>&nbsp;to
 The Next Level in 2004. &nbsp;At this time, the GameCube was reaching 
the end of it’s lifespan, and the company was making the transition to 
the Wii.</p>
<p>Five years later, Miyamoto expressed his thoughts on the GameCube, 
and considered it a very sad time when&nbsp;the general public ignored 
Nintendo’s software.</p>
<p>“This is a job where you have a plan and you polish it endlessly 
while getting help from others. If Nintendo’s games fail to stand out as
 games that aren’t made that way proliferate, then it shows that the 
creation process is for nothing, which made me very sad,” said Miyamoto.
 “That was especially obvious during the GameCube era; Nintendo titles 
were hardly even discussed by the [non-gaming] general public back 
then.”</p>

<h1>Was the GameCube profitable? Yes and No.</h1>

<p>Overall, the GameCube business was profitable thanks to the sales of 
first party software. &nbsp;If we were to speak specifically on 
hardware, the GameCube was not very profitable, and that’s partially 
because Nintendo was regularly forced to slash the price to stay 
competitive. &nbsp;Unlike the Wii, which made a profit per unit sold on 
day one, the GameCube lost money on each unit sold. &nbsp;But when you 
compare GameCube’s losses to the Xbox’s losses, the GameCube’s losses 
seem very insignificant and minor for the most part.</p>
<p>On <strong>August 31st, 2001,</strong>&nbsp;one month before GameCube’s launch, Peter Main <a title="http://thegia.com/archive/news/0108/n23r.html" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://thegia.com/archive/news/0108/n23r.html">told an interviewer</a>,&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.5em;">“We
 expect to incur a small loss on the GameCube hardware initially, and 
you’re right that it hasn’t been our habit in the past but we expect it 
to turn okay early next year.” </span>That same year, <a title="http://spong.com/article/1753/GameCube-gets-it-right-as-Merrill-Lynch-back-the-company" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://spong.com/article/1753/GameCube-gets-it-right-as-Merrill-Lynch-back-the-company">Merrill Lynch said</a>
 Nintendo would lose 2350 Yen (£14) on every GameCube sold, but it was a
 small amount compared to how much money other consoles were losing.</p>
<p>Nintendo spokesman Hiroshi Imanish&nbsp;<a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6929" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/6929">told Reuters</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>January 2002</strong>&nbsp;that GameCube’s costs of production and distribution per unit were <strong>higher than the machine’s sales price</strong>.
 The goal was to bring the company’s business back into the 
black.&nbsp;`We are discussing making GameCubes in China,” said 
Imanishi.</p>
<p>By <strong>April 2002</strong>, <a title="http://money.cnn.com/2001/11/29/technology/nintendo/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://money.cnn.com/2001/11/29/technology/nintendo/">CNN reported</a> that Nintendo was losing about $20 per GameCube sold while Microsoft was losing $100 for every Xbox sold.</p>
<p>Only six months after the North American launch,&nbsp;the GameCube would receive a price cut to $150. &nbsp;On&nbsp;<strong>May 20th, 2002,</strong>&nbsp;Nintendo’s&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.5em;">George Harrison <a title="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/05/20/nintendo-price-cut.htm" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/05/20/nintendo-price-cut.htm">told USA Today</a>, “At about $149, Nintendo will <strong>roughly break even</strong>
 on sales of each GameCube,” Harrison said. “The company has kept 
manufacturing costs lower by not offering an installed DVD player on the
 GameCube like its rival consoles.”</span></p>
<p>One year later, the sales of GameCube would reach a new low, and they were cutting into Nintendo’s profitability. &nbsp;On <strong>November 2003</strong>, Nintendo <a title="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/14/business/fi-nintendo14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/14/business/fi-nintendo14">reported a&nbsp;<strong>$26 million loss</strong></a>
 in the first half of its fiscal year due to weak sales of its GameCube 
console. Sales were estimated at roughly $2 billion, and Nintendo blamed
 the strengthening of the yen for hurting overseas income. Investors 
became worried that Nintendo was <a title="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/8886" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/8886">having trouble getting rid</a> of its excessive inventory of GameCube consoles before Christmas.</p>
<p>Eventually the console’s price had reached a new low price of $99 to make it a much more compulsive purchase for consumers. In <strong>2004</strong>, Nintendo’s Perrin Kaplan <a title="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/15/gamecube-sales-update?page=2" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/15/gamecube-sales-update?page=2">confirmed to IGN</a> that GameCube’s sales have improved, but it was still losing money on each unit sold.</p>
<p>“I would say that&nbsp;<b>our losses are really negligible. It’s such a small amount.</b>&nbsp;Plus with the amount of software that’s being sold we’re&nbsp;<b>still definitely in a solid profit situation.</b>&nbsp;We’re not in the position that I know that Microsoft has been in with the loss Xbox hardware,” said Kaplan</p>
<p>Toward the <strong>end of 2004</strong>, Japanese newspaper, Kabushiki Shimbun, <a title="http://beyond3d.com/showthread.php?t=13028" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508101624/http://beyond3d.com/showthread.php?t=13028">revealed that Nintendo</a>
 was losing&nbsp;¥20 billion ($180.8m) each year on Nintendo hardware. 
&nbsp;Because of these losses, the company decided to reduce that loss 
by reusing production plants for future hardware.</p>
