# VideoGamesMarathon
## What is this?
This was a project started in May 2018, when some friends wanted to play a bunch of sonic games. It started as a simple list of Sonic Games creates from entires on the Sonic Wiki in odt format. The list then evolved into html and has since gained two more lists. Overall however it is a list of Sonic and Metroid games which acts as a guide for a marathon of all of them.

## Why is this?
It's simple to follow and allows multiple types of playthroughs, along with games people may not usually play, as well as some interesting fan hacks and ROM Hacks. It also contains a set of simple rules.

### Why is this so bad?
Because I'm bad.

## What going on with the optional games?
These are games not in the main sonic franchise or they are remakes of older games or ports. The ROM Hacks are also optional.

## What's Psi 4
Still not sure yet.

### What's Giffgaff?
A mobile network in the UK, it's just an affiliate link. I haven't been sponsored.

## Any Cookies?
Tasty, but no.

### What's this Outdated Browser thingy (If it still works)
Err, you probably want to use something that isn't netscape, or chrome really for that matter. Use Firefox. 

### Why is the changelog so long
Because updates.

### What about the license?
The webpage's code and assets I made myself are under the GNU GPL. Assets and other things I have no idea. The fonts are free for noncommerial use.
Versions before 3.2.1/3.2.2 ish did not have a license attached and are basically therefore in the public domain I guess,  if you can find them.
Before 2.0 it wasn't even a webpage so...

### Aren't you breaking some sort of copyright law or something?
Probably. shhh.
