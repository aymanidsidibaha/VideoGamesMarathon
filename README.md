# VideoGamesMarathon
## What is this?
This was a project started in May 2018, when some friends wanted to play a bunch of sonic games. It started as a simple list of Sonic Games creates from entires on the Sonic Wiki in odt format. The list then evolved into html and has since gain two more lists. Overall however it is a list of Sonic and Metroid games which acts as a guide for a marathon of all of them.

## Why is this?
It's simple to follow and allows multiple types of playthroughs, along with games people may not usually play, as well as some interesting fan hacks and ROM Hacks. It also contains a set of simple rules.

### Why is this so bad?
Because I'm bad.

## What going on with the optional games?
These games are not essential to play to experience a great sonic experience.

##Thanks for Watching.
